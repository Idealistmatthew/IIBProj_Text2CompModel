 The Autonomous Water Filtration System ( FS ) is designed to provide clean drinking water in remote and disaster - affected areas . System operates by drawing raw water from natural sources such as rivers , lakes , or reservoirs using a high - efficiency , submersible intake pump powered by a 24V De system . This pump is equipped with a pre - filter to prevent large debris from entering the system , ensuring smooth operation and longevity . 

 Once the water is collected , water passes through a multi - stage filtration unit designed to remove 99.99 % of contaminants . This unit consists of sediment filtration , activated carbon adsorption , and a reverse osmosis membrane , effectively eliminating bacteria , viruses , heavy metals , and chemical pollutants . To further enhance water quality , the system incorporates a low - power , high - intensity Up sterilization chamber operating at a 254 nm wavelength . This chamber automatically adjusts chamber intensity based on the flow rate , ensuring thorough disinfection of any remaining microbial contaminants . 

 The entire system is powered through an integrated solar panel setup , which provides sustainable energy for off - grid functionality . A rechargeable lithium - ion battery offers backup power , enabling continuous operation for up to 12 hours during nighttime or low - sunlight conditions . Additionally , an A - enabled control and monitoring system continuously tracks key water quality parameters such as morbidity , pH , and total dissolved solids ( DS ) . The system is Io - connected , allowing real - time diagnostics and remote monitoring through a cloud - based dashboard . 

 Engineered for efficiency , durability , and ease of deployment , this water filtration system is ideal for humanitarian missions , military applications , and rural development projects . system combination of advanced filtration , intelligent monitoring , and renewable energy integration makes it a reliable and sustainable solution for providing clean drinking water in challenging environments .

 The simple pendulum is another mechanical system that moves in an oscillatory motion . pendulum consists of a point mass ‘ m ’ suspended by means of light inextensible string of length L from a fixed support as shown in Fig .   2.8 . The motion occurs in a vertical plane and is driven by a gravitational force . The forces which are acting on the mass are shown in the figure . The tangential component of the gravitational force , mg sin θ , always acts towards the mean position θ   =   0 opposite to the displacement , restoring force acting tangent to the arc .

EVOLUTION OF TWO-SURFACE FLYING MACHINE.', 'By Octave Chanute.', 'I am asked to set forth the development of the \"two-surface\" type of\\nflying machine which is now used with modifications by Wright Brothers,\\nFarman, [1] Delagrange, Herring and others.', 'This type originated with Mr. F. H. Wenham, who patented it in\\nEngland in 1866 (No.', '1571), taking out provisional papers only.', 'In the\\nabridgment of British patent Aeronautical Specifications (1893) it is\\ndescribed as follows:\\n\\n\"Two or more aeroplanes are arranged one above the other, and support a\\nframework or car containing the motive power.', 'The aeroplanes are made of\\nsilk or canvas stretched on a frame by wooden rods or steel ribs.', 'When\\nmanual power is employed the body is placed horizontally, and oars or\\npropellers are actuated by the arms or legs.', '\"A start may be obtained by lowering the legs and running down hill or\\nthe machine may be started from a moving carriage.', 'One or more screw\\npropellers may be applied for propelling when steam power is employed.\"', 'On June 27, 1866, Mr. Wenham read before the \"Aeronautical Society of\\nGreat Britain,\" then recently organized, the ablest paper ever presented\\nto that society, and thereby breathed into it a spirit which has\\ncontinued to this day.', 'In this paper he described his observations of\\nbirds, discussed the laws governing flight as to the surfaces and power\\nrequired both with wings and screws, and he then gave an account of his\\nown experiments with models and with aeroplanes of sufficient size to\\ncarry the weight of a man.', 'Second Wenham Aeroplane.', 'His second aeroplane was sixteen feet from tip to tip.', 'A trussed spar at\\nthe bottom carried six superposed bands of thin holland fabric fifteen\\ninches wide, connected with vertical webs of holland two feet apart,\\nthus virtually giving a length of wing of ninety-six feet and one\\nhundred and twenty square feet of supporting surface.', 'The man was placed\\nhorizontally on a base board beneath the spar.', 'This apparatus when tried\\nin the wind was found to be unmanageable by reason of the fluttering\\nmotions of the fabric, which was insufficiently stiffened with crinoline\\nsteel, but Mr. Wenham pointed out that this in no way invalidated\\nthe principle of the apparatus, which was to obtain large supporting\\nsurfaces without increasing unduly the leverage and consequent weight of\\nspar required, by simply superposing the surfaces.', 'This principle is entirely sound and it is surprising that it is,\\nto this day, not realized by those aviators who are hankering for\\nmonoplanes.', 'Experiments by Stringfellow.', \"The next man to test an apparatus with superposed surfaces was Mr.\\nStringfellow, who, becoming much impressed with Mr. Wenham's proposal,\\nproduced a largish model at the exhibition of the Aeronautical Society\\nin 1868.\", 'It consisted of three superposed surfaces aggregating 28 square\\nfeet and a tail of 8 square feet more.', 'The weight was under 12 pounds\\nand it was driven by a central propeller actuated by a steam engine\\noverestimated at one-third of a horsepower.', 'It ran suspended to a wire\\non its trials but failed of free flight, in consequence of defective\\nequilibrium.', 'This apparatus has since been rebuilt and is now in the\\nNational Museum of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington.', \"Linfield's\\nUnsuccessful Efforts.\", 'In 1878 Mr. Linfield tested an apparatus in England consisting of a\\ncigar-shaped car, to which was attached on each side frames five feet\\nsquare, containing each twenty-five superposed planes of stretched and\\nvarnished linen eighteen inches wide, and only two inches apart, thus\\nreminding one of a Spanish donkey with panniers.', 'The whole weighed two\\nhundred and forty pounds.', 'This was tested by being mounted on a flat car\\nbehind a locomotive going 40 miles an hour.', 'When towed by a line fifteen\\nfeet long the apparatus rose only a little from the car and exhibited\\nsuch unstable equilibrium that the experiment was not renewed.', 'The lift\\nwas only about one-third of what it would have been had the planes been\\nproperly spaced, say their full width apart, instead of one-ninth as\\nerroneously devised.', 'Renard\\'s \"Dirigible Parachute.\"', 'In 1889 Commandant Renard, the eminent superintendent of the French\\nAeronautical Department, exhibited at the Paris Exposition of that year,\\nan apparatus experimented with some years before, which he termed a\\n\"dirigible parachute.\"', 'It consisted of an oviform body to which were\\npivoted two upright slats carrying above the body nine long superposed\\nflat blades spaced about one-third of their width apart.', 'When this\\napparatus was properly set at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the\\nbody and dropped from a balloon, it travelled back against the wind for\\na considerable distance before alighting.', 'The course could be varied\\nby a rudder.', 'No practical application seems to have been made of this\\ndevice by the French War Department, but Mr. J. P. Holland, the\\ninventor of the submarine boat which bears his name, proposed in 1893\\nan arrangement of pivoted framework attached to the body of a flying\\nmachine which combines the principle of Commandant Renard with the\\ncurved blades experimented with by Mr. Phillips, now to be noticed, with\\nthe addition of lifting screws inserted among the blades.', 'Phillips Fails on Stability Problem.', 'In 1893 Mr. Horatio Phillips, of England, after some very interesting\\nexperiments with various wing sections, from which he deduced\\nconclusions as to the shape of maximum lift, tested an apparatus\\nresembling a Venetian blind which consisted of fifty wooden slats of\\npeculiar shape, 22 feet long, one and a half inches wide, and two inches\\napart, set in ten vertical upright boards.', 'All this was carried upon a\\nbody provided with three wheels.', 'It weighed 420 pounds and was driven\\nat 40 miles an hour on a wooden sidewalk by a steam engine of nine\\nhorsepower which actuated a two-bladed screw.', 'The lift was satisfactory,\\nbeing perhaps 70 pounds per horsepower, but the equilibrium was quite\\nbad and the experiments were discontinued.', 'They were taken up again in\\n1904 with a similar apparatus large enough to carry a passenger, but the\\nlongitudinal equilibrium was found to be defective.', 'Then in 1907 a new\\nmachine was tested, in which four sets of frames, carrying similar\\nsets of slat \"sustainers\" were inserted, and with this arrangement the\\nlongitudinal stability was found to be very satisfactory.', 'The whole\\napparatus, with the operator, weighed 650 pounds.', 'It flew about 200\\nyards when driven by a motor of 20 to 22 h.p.', 'at 30 miles an hour,\\nthus exhibiting a lift of about 32 pounds per h.p., while it will be\\nremembered that the aeroplane of Wright Brothers exhibits a lifting\\ncapacity of 50 pounds to the h.p.', \"Hargrave's Kite Experiments.\", 'After experimenting with very many models and building no less than\\neighteen monoplane flying model machines, actuated by rubber, by\\ncompressed air and by steam, Mr. Lawrence Hargrave, of Sydney, New South\\nWales, invented the cellular kite which bears his name and made it known\\nin a paper contributed to the Chicago Conference on Aerial Navigation\\nin 1893, describing several varieties.', 'The modern construction is well\\nknown, and consists of two cells, each of superposed surfaces with\\nvertical side fins, placed one behind the other and connected by a\\nrod or frame.', 'This flies with great steadiness without a tail.', \"Mr.\\nHargrave's idea was to use a team of these kites, below which he\\nproposed to suspend a motor and propeller from which a line would be\\ncarried to an anchor in the ground.\", 'Then by actuating the propeller the\\nwhole apparatus would move forward, pick up the anchor and fly away.', 'He\\nsaid: \"The next step is clear enough, namely, that a flying machine with\\nacres of surface can be safely got under way or anchored and hauled to\\nthe ground by means of the string of kites.\"', 'The first tentative experiments did not result well and emphasized the\\nnecessity for a light motor, so that Mr. Hargrave has since been engaged\\nin developing one, not having convenient access to those which have been\\nproduced by the automobile designers and builders.', 'Experiments With Glider Model.', 'And here a curious reminiscence may be indulged in.', 'In 1888 the present\\nwriter experimented with a two-cell gliding model, precisely similar to\\na Hargrave kite, as will be confirmed by Mr.', 'Herring.', \"It was frequently\\ntested by launching from the top of a three-story house and glided\\ndownward very steadily in all sorts of breezes, but the angle of descent\\nwas much steeper than that of birds, and the weight sustained per square\\nfoot was less than with single cells, in consequence of the lesser\\nsupport afforded by the rear cell, which operated upon air already set\\nin motion downward by the front cell, so nothing more was done with\\nit, for it never occurred to the writer to try it as a kite and he thus\\nmissed the distinction which attaches to Hargrave's name.\", 'Sir Hiram Maxim also introduced fore and aft superposed surfaces in his\\nwondrous flying machine of 1893, but he relied chiefly for the lift upon\\nhis main large surface and this necessitated so many guys, to prevent\\ndistortion, as greatly to increase the head resistance and this,\\ntogether with the unstable equilibrium, made it evident that the design\\nof the machine would have to be changed.', 'How Lilienthal Was Killed.', 'In 1895, Otto Lilienthal, the father of modern aviation, the man to\\nwhose method of experimenting almost all present successes are due,\\nafter making something like two thousand glides with monoplanes, added\\na superposed surface to his apparatus and found the control of it much\\nimproved.', 'The two surfaces were kept apart by two struts or vertical\\nposts with a few guy wires, but the connecting joints were weak and\\nthere was nothing like trussing.', 'This eventually cost his most useful\\nlife.', 'Two weeks before that distressing loss to science, Herr Wilhelm\\nKress, the distinguished and veteran aviator of Vienna, witnessed a\\nnumber of glides by Lilienthal with his double-decked apparatus.', 'He\\nnoticed that it was much wracked and wobbly and wrote to me after the\\naccident: \"The connection of the wings and the steering arrangement were\\nvery bad and unreliable.', 'I warned Herr Lilienthal very seriously.', 'He\\npromised me that he would soon put it in order, but I fear that he did\\nnot attend to it immediately.\"', 'In point of fact, Lilienthal had built a new machine, upon a different\\nprinciple, from which he expected great results, and intended to make\\nbut very few more flights with the old apparatus.', 'He unwisely made one\\ntoo many and, like Pilcher, was the victim of a distorted apparatus.', 'Probably one of the joints of the struts gave way, the upper surface\\nblew back and Lilienthal, who was well forward on the lower surface, was\\npitched headlong to destruction.', 'Experiments by the Writer.', 'In 1896, assisted by Mr.', 'Herring and Mr. Avery, I experimented with\\nseveral full sized gliding machines, carrying a man.', \"The first was a\\nLilienthal monoplane which was deemed so cranky that it was discarded\\nafter making about one hundred glides, six weeks before Lilienthal's\\naccident.\", 'The second was known as the multiple winged machine and\\nfinally developed into five pairs of pivoted wings, trussed together at\\nthe front and one pair in the rear.', 'It glided at angles of descent of 10\\nor 11 degrees or of one in five, and this was deemed too steep.', 'Then\\nMr.', 'Herring and myself made computations to analyze the resistances.', 'We\\nattributed much of them to the five front spars of the wings and on\\na sheet of cross-barred paper I at once drew the design for a new\\nthree-decked machine to be built by Mr.', 'Herring.', 'Being a builder of bridges, I trussed these surfaces together, in order\\nto obtain strength and stiffness.', 'When tested in gliding flight the\\nlower surface was found too near the ground.', 'It was taken off and the\\nremaining apparatus now consisted of two surfaces connected together\\nby a girder composed of vertical posts and diagonal ties, specifically\\nknown as a \"Pratt truss.\"', 'Then Mr.', 'Herring and Mr. Avery together\\ndevised and put on an elastic attachment to the tail.', 'This machine\\nproved a success, it being safe and manageable.', 'Over 700 glides were\\nmade with it at angles of descent of 8 to 10 degrees, or one in six to\\none in seven.', 'First Proposed by Wenham.', 'The elastic tail attachment and the trussing of the connecting frame of\\nthe superposed wings were the only novelties in this machine, for the\\nsuperposing of the surfaces had first been proposed by Wenham, but in\\naccordance with the popular perception, which bestows all the credit\\nupon the man who adds the last touch making for success to the labors\\nof his predecessors, the machine has since been known by many persons as\\nthe \"Chanute type\" of gliders, much to my personal gratification.', 'It has since been improved in many ways.', 'Wright Brothers, disregarding\\nthe fashion which prevails among birds, have placed the tail in front\\nof their apparatus and called it a front rudder, besides placing the\\noperator in horizontal position instead of upright, as I did; and also\\nproviding a method of warping the wings to preserve equilibrium.', 'Farman\\nand Delagrange, under the very able guidance and constructive work of\\nVoisin brothers, then substituted many details, including a box tail for\\nthe dart-like tail which I used.', 'This may have increased the resistance,\\nbut it adds to the steadiness.', 'Now the tendency in France seems to be to\\ngo back to the monoplane.', 'Monoplane Idea Wrong.', 'The advocates of the single supporting surface are probably mistaken.', 'It\\nis true that a single surface shows a greater lift per square foot than\\nsuperposed surfaces for a given speed, but the increased weight due to\\nleverage more than counterbalances this advantage by requiring heavy\\nspars and some guys.', 'I believe that the future aeroplane dynamic flier\\nwill consist of superposed surfaces, and, now that it has been found\\nthat by imbedding suitably shaped spars in the cloth the head resistance\\nmay be much diminished, I see few objections to superposing three, four\\nor even five surfaces properly trussed, and thus obtaining a compact,\\nhandy, manageable and comparatively light apparatus.', '[2]\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.', 'THEORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND USE.', 'While every craft that navigates the air is an airship, all airships are\\nnot flying machines.', 'The balloon, for instance, is an airship, but it is\\nnot what is known among aviators as a flying machine.', 'This latter term\\nis properly used only in referring to heavier-than-air machines which\\nhave no gas-bag lifting devices, and are made to really fly by the\\napplication of engine propulsion.', 'Mechanical Birds.', 'All successful flying machines--and there are a number of them--are\\nbased on bird action.', 'The various designers have studied bird flight\\nand soaring, mastered its technique as devised by Nature, and the modern\\nflying machine is the result.', 'On an exaggerated, enlarged scale the\\nmachines which are now navigating the air are nothing more nor less than\\nmechanical birds.', 'Origin of the Aeroplane.', 'Octave Chanute, of Chicago, may well be called \"the developer of the\\nflying machine.\"', 'Leaving balloons and various forms of gas-bags out\\nof consideration, other experimenters, notably Langley and Lilienthal,\\nantedated him in attempting the navigation of the air on aeroplanes,\\nor flying machines, but none of them were wholly successful, and it\\nremained for Chanute to demonstrate the practicability of what was then\\ncalled the gliding machine.', 'This term was adopted because the apparatus\\nwas, as the name implies, simply a gliding machine, being without motor\\npropulsion, and intended solely to solve the problem of the best form of\\nconstruction.', 'The biplane, used by Chanute in 1896, is still the basis\\nof most successful flying machines, the only radical difference being\\nthat motors, rudders, etc., have been added.', \"Character of Chanute's Experiments.\", \"It was the privilege of the author of this book to be Mr. Chanute's\\nguest at Millers, Indiana, in 1896, when, in collaboration with Messrs.\", 'Herring and Avery, he was conducting the series of experiments which\\nhave since made possible the construction of the modern flying machine\\nwhich such successful aviators as the Wright brothers and others are\\nnow using.', 'It was a wild country, much frequented by eagles, hawks, and\\nsimilar birds.', 'The enthusiastic trio, Chanute, Herring and Avery, would\\nwatch for hours the evolutions of some big bird in the air, agreeing\\nin the end on the verdict, \"When we master the principle of that bird\\'s\\nsoaring without wing action, we will have come close to solving the\\nproblem of the flying machine.\"', 'Aeroplanes of various forms were constructed by Mr. Chanute with the\\nassistance of Messrs.', \"Herring and Avery until, at the time of the\\nwriter's visit, they had settled upon the biplane, or two-surface\\nmachine.\", 'Mr.', 'Herring later equipped this with a rudder, and made other\\nadditions, but the general idea is still the basis of the Wright,\\nCurtiss, and other machines in which, by the aid of gasolene motors,\\nlong flights have been made.', 'Developments by the Wrights.', \"In 1900 the Wright brothers, William and Orville, who were then in\\nthe bicycle business in Dayton, Ohio, became interested in Chanute's\\nexperiments and communicated with him.\", \"The result was that the Wrights\\ntook up Chanute's ideas and developed them further, making many\\nadditions of their own, one of which was the placing of a rudder in\\nfront, and the location of the operator horizontally on the machine,\\nthus diminishing by four-fifths the wind resistance of the man's\\nbody.\", 'For three years the Wrights experimented with the glider before\\nventuring to add a motor, which was not done until they had thoroughly\\nmastered the control of their movements in the air.', 'Limits of the Flying Machine.', 'In the opinion of competent experts it is idle to look for a commercial\\nfuture for the flying machine.', 'There is, and always will be, a limit to\\nits carrying capacity which will prohibit its employment for passenger\\nor freight purposes in a wholesale or general way.', 'There are some, of\\ncourse, who will argue that because a machine will carry two people\\nanother may be constructed that will carry a dozen, but those who make\\nthis contention do not understand the theory of weight sustentation in\\nthe air; or that the greater the load the greater must be the lifting\\npower (motors and plane surface), and that there is a limit to these--as\\nwill be explained later on--beyond which the aviator cannot go.', 'Some Practical Uses.', 'At the same time there are fields in which the flying machine may be\\nused to great advantage.', 'These are:\\n\\nSports--Flying machine races or flights will always be popular by reason\\nof the element of danger.', 'It is a strange, but nevertheless a true\\nproposition, that it is this element which adds zest to all sporting\\nevents.', 'Scientific--For exploration of otherwise inaccessible regions such as\\ndeserts, mountain tops, etc.', \"Reconnoitering--In time of war flying machines may be used to advantage\\nto spy out an enemy's encampment, ascertain its defenses, etc.\", 'CHAPTER III.', 'MECHANICAL BIRD ACTION\\n\\nIn order to understand the theory of the modern flying machine one must\\nalso understand bird action and wind action.', 'In this connection the\\nfollowing simple experiment will be of interest:\\n\\nTake a circular-shaped bit of cardboard, like the lid of a hat box, and\\nremove the bent-over portion so as to have a perfectly flat surface with\\na clean, sharp edge.', \"Holding the cardboard at arm's length, withdraw\\nyour hand, leaving the cardboard without support.\", 'What is the result?', 'The cardboard, being heavier than air, and having nothing to sustain\\nit, will fall to the ground.', 'Pick it up and throw it, with considerable\\nforce, against the wind edgewise.', 'What happens?', 'Instead of falling to\\nthe ground, the cardboard sails along on the wind, remaining afloat so\\nlong as it is in motion.', 'It seeks the ground, by gravity, only as the\\nmotion ceases, and then by easy stages, instead of dropping abruptly as\\nin the first instance.', 'Here we have a homely, but accurate illustration of the action of the\\nflying machine.', 'The motor does for the latter what the force of your arm\\ndoes for the cardboard--imparts a motion which keeps it afloat.', 'The only\\nreal difference is that the motion given by the motor is continuous and\\nmuch more powerful than that given by your arm.', 'The action of the latter\\nis limited and the end of its propulsive force is reached within a\\nsecond or two after it is exerted, while the action of the motor is\\nprolonged.', 'Another Simple Illustration.', 'Another simple means of illustrating the principle of flying machine\\noperation, so far as sustentation and the elevation and depression of\\nthe planes is concerned, is explained in the accompanying diagram.', 'A is a piece of cardboard about 2 by 3 inches in size.', 'B is a piece of\\npaper of the same size pasted to one edge of A.', 'If you bend the paper\\nto a curve, with convex side up and blow across it as shown in Figure\\nC, the paper will rise instead of being depressed.', 'The dotted lines show\\nthat the air is passing over the top of the curved paper and yet, no\\nmatter how hard you may blow, the effect will be to elevate the paper,\\ndespite the fact that the air is passing over, instead of under the\\ncurved surface.', 'In Figure D we have an opposite effect.', 'Here the paper is in a curve\\nexactly the reverse of that shown in Figure C, bringing the concave side\\nup.', 'Now if you will again blow across the surface of the card the action\\nof the paper will be downward--it will be impossible to make it rise.', 'The harder you blow the greater will be the downward movement.', 'Principle In General Use.', 'This principle is taken advantage of in the construction of all\\nsuccessful flying machines.', 'Makers of monoplanes and biplanes alike\\nadhere to curved bodies, with the concave surface facing downward.', 'Straight planes were tried for a time, but found greatly lacking in the\\npower of sustentation.', 'By curving the planes, and placing the concave\\nsurface downward, a sort of inverted bowl is formed in which the air\\ngathers and exerts a buoyant effect.', 'Just what the ratio of the curve\\nshould be is a matter of contention.', 'In some instances one inch to the\\nfoot is found to be satisfactory; in others this is doubled, and there\\nare a few cases in which a curve of as much as 3 inches to the foot has\\nbeen used.', 'Right here it might be well to explain that the word \"plane\" applied to\\nflying machines of modern construction is in reality a misnomer.', 'Plane\\nindicates a flat, level surface.', 'As most successful flying machines have\\ncurved supporting surfaces it is clearly wrong to speak of \"planes,\" or\\n\"aeroplanes.\"', 'Usage, however, has made the terms convenient and, as they\\nare generally accepted and understood by the public, they are used in\\nlike manner in this volume.', 'Getting Under Headway.', 'A bird, on first rising from the ground, or beginning its flight from\\na tree, will flap its wings to get under headway.', 'Here again we have\\nanother illustration of the manner in which a flying machine gets under\\nheadway--the motor imparts the force necessary to put the machine into\\nthe air, but right here the similarity ceases.', 'If the machine is to be\\nkept afloat the motor must be kept moving.', 'A flying machine will not\\nsustain itself; it will not remain suspended in the air unless it is\\nunder headway.', 'This is because it is heavier than air, and gravity draws\\nit to the ground.', 'Puzzle in Bird Soaring.', 'But a bird, which is also heavier than air, will remain suspended, in a\\ncalm, will even soar and move in a circle, without apparent movement\\nof its wings.', 'This is explained on the theory that there are generally\\nvertical columns of air in circulation strong enough to sustain a bird,\\nbut much too weak to exert any lifting power on a flying machine, It is\\neasy to understand how a bird can remain suspended when the wind is\\nin action, but its suspension in a seeming dead calm was a puzzle\\nto scientists until Mr. Chanute advanced the proposition of vertical\\ncolumns of air.', 'Modeled Closely After Birds.', 'So far as possible, builders of flying machines have taken what may\\nbe called \"the architecture\" of birds as a model.', 'This is readily\\nnoticeable in the form of construction.', 'When a bird is in motion its\\nwings (except when flapping) are extended in a straight line at right\\nangles to its body.', 'This brings a sharp, thin edge against the air,\\noffering the least possible surface for resistance, while at the same\\ntime a broad surface for support is afforded by the flat, under side of\\nthe wings.', 'Identically the same thing is done in the construction of the\\nflying machine.', 'Note, for instance, the marked similarity in form as shown in the\\nillustration in Chapter II.', 'Here A is the bird, and B the general\\noutline of the machine.', \"The thin edge of the plane in the latter is\\nalmost a duplicate of that formed by the outstretched wings of the bird,\\nwhile the rudder plane in the rear serves the same purpose as the bird's\\ntail.\", 'CHAPTER IV.', 'VARIOUS FORMS OF FLYING MACHINES.', 'There are three distinct and radically different forms of flying\\nmachines.', 'These are:\\n\\nAeroplanes, helicopters and ornithopers.', 'Of these the aeroplane takes precedence and is used almost exclusively\\nby successful aviators, the helicopters and ornithopers having been\\ntried and found lacking in some vital features, while at the same\\ntime in some respects the helicopter has advantages not found in the\\naeroplane.', 'What the Helicopter Is.', 'The helicopter gets its name from being fitted with vertical propellers\\nor helices (see illustration) by the action of which the machine is\\nraised directly from the ground into the air.', 'This does away with the\\nnecessity for getting the machine under a gliding headway before\\nit floats, as is the case with the aeroplane, and consequently the\\nhelicopter can be handled in a much smaller space than is required for\\nan aeroplane.', 'This, in many instances, is an important advantage, but it\\nis the only one the helicopter possesses, and is more than overcome\\nby its drawbacks.', 'The most serious of these is that the helicopter is\\ndeficient in sustaining capacity, and requires too much motive power.', 'Form of the Ornithopter.', 'The ornithopter has hinged planes which work like the wings of a bird.', 'At first thought this would seem to be the correct principle, and most\\nof the early experimenters conducted their operations on this line.', 'It\\nis now generally understood, however, that the bird in soaring is in\\nreality an aeroplane, its extended wings serving to sustain, as well as\\npropel, the body.', 'At any rate the ornithoper has not been successful in\\naviation, and has been interesting mainly as an ingenious toy.', 'Attempts\\nto construct it on a scale that would permit of its use by man in actual\\naerial flights have been far from encouraging.', 'Three Kinds of Aeroplanes.', 'There are three forms of aeroplanes, with all of which more or less\\nsuccess has been attained.', 'These are:\\n\\nThe monoplane, a one-surfaced plane, like that used by Bleriot.', 'The biplane, a two-surfaced plane, now used by the Wrights, Curtiss,\\nFarman, and others.', 'The triplane, a three-surfaced plane This form is but little used,\\nits only prominent advocate at present being Elle Lavimer, a Danish\\nexperimenter, who has not thus far accomplished much.', 'Whatever of real success has been accomplished in aviation may be\\ncredited to the monoplane and biplane, with the balance in favor of\\nthe latter.', 'The monoplane is the more simple in construction and, where\\nweight-sustaining capacity is not a prime requisite, may probably be\\nfound the most convenient.', 'This opinion is based on the fact that the\\nsmaller the surface of the plane the less will be the resistance offered\\nto the air, and the greater will be the speed at which the machine\\nmay be moved.', 'On the other hand, the biplane has a much greater plane\\nsurface (double that of a monoplane of the same size) and consequently\\nmuch greater weight-carrying capacity.', 'Differences in Biplanes.', 'While all biplanes are of the same general construction so far as the\\nmain planes are concerned, each aviator has his own ideas as to the\\n\"rigging.\"', 'Wright, for instance, places a double horizontal rudder in front, with\\na vertical rudder in the rear.', 'There are no partitions between the\\nmain planes, and the bicycle wheels used on other forms are replaced by\\nskids.', 'Voisin, on the contrary, divides the main planes with vertical\\npartitions to increase stability in turning; uses a single-plane\\nhorizontal rudder in front, and a big box-tail with vertical rudder at\\nthe rear; also the bicycle wheels.', 'Curtiss attaches horizontal stabilizing surfaces to the upper plane;\\nhas a double horizontal rudder in front, with a vertical rudder\\nand horizontal stabilizing surfaces in rear.', 'Also the bicycle wheel\\nalighting gear.', 'CHAPTER V. CONSTRUCTING A GLIDING MACHINE.', 'First decide upon the kind of a machine you want--monoplane, biplane,\\nor triplane.', 'For a novice the biplane will, as a rule, be found the\\nmost satisfactory as it is more compact and therefore the more easily\\nhandled.', 'This will be easily understood when we realize that the surface\\nof a flying machine should be laid out in proportion to the amount of\\nweight it will have to sustain.', 'The generally accepted rule is that 152\\nsquare feet of surface will sustain the weight of an average-sized man,\\nsay 170 pounds.', 'Now it follows that if these 152 square feet of surface\\nare used in one plane, as in the monoplane, the length and width of this\\nplane must be greater than if the same amount of surface is secured by\\nusing two planes--the biplane.', 'This results in the biplane being more\\ncompact and therefore more readily manipulated than the monoplane, which\\nis an important item for a novice.', 'Glider the Basis of Success.', 'Flying machines without motors are called gliders.', 'In making a flying\\nmachine you first construct the glider.', 'If you use it in this form it\\nremains a glider.', 'If you install a motor it becomes a flying machine.', 'You must have a good glider as the basis of a successful flying machine.', 'It will be well for the novice, the man who has never had any experience\\nas an aviator, to begin with a glider and master its construction and\\noperation before he essays the more pretentious task of handling a\\nfully-equipped flying machine.', 'In fact, it is essential that he should\\ndo so.', 'Plans for Handy Glider.', 'A glider with a spread (advancing edge) of 20 feet, and a breadth or\\ndepth of 4 feet, will be about right to begin with.', \"Two planes of this\\nsize will give the 152 square yards of surface necessary to sustain a\\nman's weight.\", 'Remember that in referring to flying machine measurements\\n\"spread\" takes the place of what would ordinarily be called \"length,\"\\nand invariably applies to the long or advancing edge of the machine\\nwhich cuts into the air.', 'Thus, a glider is spoken of as being 20 feet\\nspread, and 4 feet in depth.', \"So far as mastering the control of the\\nmachine is concerned, learning to balance one's self in the air, guiding\\nthe machine in any desired direction by changing the position of the\\nbody, etc., all this may be learned just as readily, and perhaps more\\nso, with a 20-foot glider than with a larger apparatus.\", 'Kind of Material Required.', 'There are three all-important features in flying machine construction,\\nviz.', ': lightness, strength and extreme rigidity.', 'Spruce is the wood\\ngenerally used for glider frames.', 'Oak, ash and hickory are all stronger,\\nbut they are also considerably heavier, and where the saving of weight\\nis essential, the difference is largely in favor of spruce.', 'This will be\\nseen in the following table:\\n\\n                   Weight       Tensile          Compressive\\n                per cubic ft.', 'Strength           Strength\\n      Wood         in lbs.', 'lbs.', 'per sq.', 'in.', 'lbs.', 'per sq in.', 'Hickory           53           12,000          8,500\\n   Oak               50           12,000          9,000\\n   Ash               38           12,000          6,000\\n   Walnut            38            8,000

percentage\\nof tensile strength than any of the other woods.', 'It is also easier to\\nfind in long, straight-grained pieces free from knots, and it is this\\nkind only that should be used in flying machine construction.', 'You will next need some spools or hanks of No.', '6 linen shoe\\nthread, metal sockets, a supply of strong piano wire, a quantity of\\nclosely-woven silk or cotton cloth, glue, turnbuckles, varnish, etc.', 'Names of the Various Parts.', 'The long strips, four in number, which form the front and rear edges of\\nthe upper and lower frames, are called the horizontal beams.', 'These are\\neach 20 feet in length.', 'These horizontal beams are connected by upright\\nstrips, 4 feet long, called stanchions.', 'There are usually 12 of these,\\nsix on the front edge, and six on the rear.', 'They serve to hold the upper\\nplane away from the lower one.', 'Next comes the ribs.', 'These are 4 feet in\\nlength (projecting for a foot over the rear beam), and while intended\\nprincipally as a support to the cloth covering of the planes, also\\ntend to hold the frame together in a horizontal position just as the\\nstanchions do in the vertical.', 'There are forty-one of these ribs,\\ntwenty-one on the upper and twenty on the lower plane.', 'Then come the\\nstruts, the main pieces which join the horizontal beams.', 'All of these\\nparts are shown in the illustrations, reference to which will make the\\nmeaning of the various names clear.', 'Quantity and Cost of Material.', 'For the horizontal beams four pieces of spruce, 20 feet long, 1 1/2\\ninches wide and 3/4 inch thick are necessary.', 'These pieces must be\\nstraight-grain, and absolutely free from knots.', 'If it is impossible to\\nobtain clear pieces of this length, shorter ones may be spliced, but\\nthis is not advised as it adds materially to the weight.', 'The twelve\\nstanchions should be 4 feet long and 7/8 inch in diameter and rounded\\nin form so as to offer as little resistance as possible to the wind.', 'The\\nstruts, there are twelve of them, are 3 feet long by 11/4 x 1/2 inch.', 'For a 20-foot biplane about 20 yards of stout silk or unbleached muslin,\\nof standard one yard width, will be needed.', 'The forty-one ribs are\\neach 4 feet long, and 1/2 inch square.', 'A roll of No.', '12 piano wire,\\ntwenty-four sockets, a package of small copper tacks, a pot of glue, and\\nsimilar accessories will be required.', 'The entire cost of this material\\nshould not exceed $20.', 'The wood and cloth will be the two largest\\nitems, and these should not cost more than $10.', 'This leaves $10 for the\\nvarnish, wire, tacks, glue, and other incidentals.', 'This estimate is\\nmade for cost of materials only, it being taken for granted that the\\nexperimenter will construct his own glider.', 'Should the services of a\\ncarpenter be required the total cost will probably approximate $60 or\\n$70.', 'Application of the Rudders.', 'The figures given also include the expense of rudders, but the details\\nof these have not been included as the glider is really complete without\\nthem.', 'Some of the best flights the writer ever saw were made by Mr. A.\\nM. Herring in a glider without a rudder, and yet there can be no doubt\\nthat a rudder, properly proportioned and placed, especially a rear\\nrudder, is of great value to the aviator as it keeps the machine with\\nits head to the wind, which is the only safe position for a novice.', 'For\\ninitial educational purposes, however, a rudder is not essential as the\\nglides will, or should, be made on level ground, in moderate, steady\\nwind currents, and at a modest elevation.', 'The addition of a rudder,\\ntherefore, may well be left until the aviator has become reasonably\\nexpert in the management of his machine.', 'Putting the Machine Together.', 'Having obtained the necessary material, the first move is to have the\\nrib pieces steamed and curved.', 'This curve may be slight, about 2 inches\\nfor the 4 feet.', 'While this is being done the other parts should be\\ncarefully rounded so the square edges will be taken off.', 'This may be\\ndone with sand paper.', 'Next apply a coat of shellac, and when dry rub\\nit down thoroughly with fine sand paper.', 'When the ribs are curved treat\\nthem in the same way.', 'Lay two of the long horizontal frame pieces on the floor 3 feet apart.', 'Between these place six of the strut pieces.', 'Put one at each end, and\\neach 4 1/2 feet put another, leaving a 2-foot space in the center.', 'This\\nwill give you four struts 4 1/2 feet apart, and two in the center 2 feet\\napart, as shown in the illustration.', 'This makes five rectangles.', 'Be sure\\nthat the points of contact are perfect, and that the struts are exactly\\nat right angles with the horizontal frames.', 'This is a most important\\nfeature because if your frame \"skews\" or twists you cannot keep it\\nstraight in the air.', 'Now glue the ends of the struts to the frame\\npieces, using plenty of glue, and nail on strips that will hold the\\nframe in place while the glue is drying.', 'The next day lash the joints\\ntogether firmly with the shoe thread, winding it as you would to mend a\\nbroken gun stock, and over each layer put a coating of glue.', 'This done,\\nthe other frame pieces and struts may be treated in the same way, and\\nyou will thus get the foundations for the two planes.', 'Another Way of Placing Struts.', 'In the machines built for professional use a stronger and more certain\\nform of construction is desired.', 'This is secured by the placing the\\nstruts for the lower plane under the frame piece, and those for the\\nupper plane over it, allowing them in each instance to come out flush\\nwith the outer edges of the frame pieces.', 'They are then securely\\nfastened with a tie plate or clamp which passes over the end of the\\nstrut and is bound firmly against the surface of the frame piece by the\\neye bolts of the stanchion sockets.', 'Placing the Rib Pieces.', 'Take one of the frames and place on it the ribs, with the arched side\\nup, letting one end of the ribs come flush with the front edge of the\\nforward frame, and the other end projecting about a foot beyond the rear\\nframe.', 'The manner of fastening the ribs to the frame pieces is optional.', 'In some cases they are lashed with shoe thread, and in others clamped\\nwith a metal clamp fastened with 1/2-inch wood screws.', 'Where clamps and\\nscrews are used care should be taken to make slight holes in the wood\\nwith an awl before starting the screws so as to lessen any tendency to\\nsplit the wood.', 'On the top frame, twenty-one ribs placed one foot apart\\nwill be required.', \"On the lower frame, because of the opening left for\\nthe operator's body, you will need only twenty.\", 'Joining the Two Frames.', 'The two frames must now be joined together.', 'For this you will need\\ntwenty-four aluminum or iron sockets which may be purchased at a\\nfoundry or hardware shop.', 'These sockets, as the name implies, provide\\na receptacle in which the end of a stanchion is firmly held, and have\\nflanges with holes for eye-bolts which hold them firmly to the frame\\npieces, and also serve to hold the guy wires.', 'In addition to these\\neye-bolt holes there are two others through which screws are fastened\\ninto the frame pieces.', 'On the front frame piece of the bottom plane\\nplace six sockets, beginning at the end of the frame, and locating them\\nexactly opposite the struts.', 'Screw the sockets into position with wood\\nscrews, and then put the eye-bolts in place.', 'Repeat the operation on the\\nrear frame.', 'Next put the sockets for the upper plane frame in place.', 'You are now ready to bring the two planes together.', 'Begin by inserting\\nthe stanchions in the sockets in the lower plane.', 'The ends may need a\\nlittle rubbing with sandpaper to get them into the sockets, but care\\nmust be taken to have them fit snugly.', 'When all the stanchions are in\\nplace on the lower plane, lift the upper plane into position, and fit\\nthe sockets over the upper ends of the stanchions.', 'Trussing with Guy Wires.', 'The next move is to \"tie\" the frame together rigidly by the aid of guy\\nwires.', 'This is where the No.', '12 piano wire comes in.', 'Each rectangle\\nformed by the struts and stanchions with the exception of the small\\ncenter one, is to be wired separately as shown in the illustration.', 'At\\neach of the eight corners forming the rectangle the ring of one of the\\neye-bolts will be found.', 'There are two ways of doing this \"tieing,\" or\\ntrussing.', 'One is to run the wires diagonally from eye-bolt to eye-bolt,\\ndepending upon main strength to pull them taut enough, and then twist\\nthe ends so as to hold.', 'The other is to first make a loop of wire\\nat each eye-bolt, and connect these loops to the main wires with\\nturn-buckles.', 'This latter method is the best, as it admits of the\\ntension being regulated by simply turning the buckle so as to draw the\\nends of the wire closer together.', 'A glance at the illustration will make\\nthis plain, and also show how the wires are to be placed.', 'The proper\\ndegree of tension may be determined in the following manner:\\n\\nAfter the frame is wired place each end on a saw-horse so as to lift the\\nentire frame clear of the work-shop floor.', 'Get under it, in the center\\nrectangle and, grasping the center struts, one in each hand, put your\\nentire weight on the structure.', 'If it is properly put together it will\\nremain rigid and unyielding.', 'Should it sag ever so slightly the tension\\nof the wires must be increased until any tendency to sag, no matter how\\nslight it may be, is overcome.', 'Putting on the Cloth.', 'We are now ready to put on the cloth covering which holds the air and\\nmakes the machine buoyant.', 'The kind of material employed is of small\\naccount so long as it is light, strong, and wind-proof, or nearly so.', 'Some aviators use what is called rubberized silk, others prefer balloon\\ncloth.', 'Ordinary muslin of good quality, treated with a coat of light\\nvarnish after it is in place, will answer all the purposes of the\\namateur.', 'Cut the cloth into strips a little over 4 feet in length.', 'As you have\\n20 feet in width to cover, and the cloth is one yard wide, you will need\\nseven strips for each plane, so as to allow for laps, etc.', 'This will\\ngive you fourteen strips.', 'Glue the end of each strip around the front\\nhorizontal beams of the planes, and draw each strip back, over the ribs,\\ntacking the edges to the ribs as you go along, with small copper or\\nbrass tacks.', 'In doing this keep the cloth smooth and stretched tight.', 'Tacks should also be used in addition to the glue, to hold the cloth to\\nthe horizontal beams.', 'Next, give the cloth a coat of varnish on the clear, or upper side, and\\nwhen this is dry your glider will be ready for use.', 'Reinforcing the Cloth.', 'While not absolutely necessary for amateur purposes, reinforcement\\nof the cloth, so as to avoid any tendency to split or tear out from\\nwind-pressure, is desirable.', 'One way of doing this is to tack narrow\\nstrips of some heavier material, like felt, over the cloth where it laps\\non the ribs.', 'Another is to sew slips or pockets in the cloth itself and\\nlet the ribs run through them.', 'Still another method is to sew 2-inch\\nstrips (of the same material as the cover) on the cloth, placing them\\nabout one yard apart, but having them come in the center of each piece\\nof covering, and not on the laps where the various pieces are joined.', 'Use of Armpieces.', 'Should armpieces be desired, aside from those afforded by the center\\nstruts, take two pieces of spruce, 3 feet long, by 1 x 1 3/4 inches, and\\nbolt them to the front and rear beams of the lower plane about 14 inches\\napart.', 'These will be more comfortable than using the struts, as the\\noperator will not have to spread his arms so much.', 'In using the struts\\nthe operator, as a rule, takes hold of them with his hands, while with\\nthe armpieces, as the name implies, he places his arms over them, one of\\nthe strips coming under each armpit.', 'Frequently somebody asks why the ribs should be curved.', 'The answer is\\neasy.', 'The curvature tends to direct the air downward toward the rear\\nand, as the air is thus forced downward, there is more or less of an\\nimpact which assists in propelling the aeroplane upwards.', 'CHAPTER VI.', 'LEARNING TO FLY.', \"Don't be too ambitious at the start.\", 'Go slow, and avoid unnecessary\\nrisks.', 'At its best there is an element of danger in aviation which\\ncannot be entirely eliminated, but it may be greatly reduced and\\nminimized by the use of common sense.', 'Theoretically, the proper way to begin a glide is from the top of an\\nincline, facing against the wind, so that the machine will soar until\\nthe attraction of gravitation draws it gradually to the ground.', 'This is\\nthe manner in which experienced aviators operate, but it must be kept in\\nmind that these men are experts.', 'They understand air currents, know how\\nto control the action and direction of their machines by shifting the\\nposition of their bodies, and by so doing avoid accidents which would be\\nunavoidable by a novice.', 'Begin on Level Ground.', 'Make your first flights on level ground, having a couple of men to\\nassist you in getting the apparatus under headway.', 'Take your position in\\nthe center rectangle, back far enough to give the forward edges of the\\nglider an inclination to tilt upward very slightly.', 'Now start and run\\nforward at a moderately rapid gait, one man at each end of the glider\\nassisting you.', 'As the glider cuts into the air the wind will catch under\\nthe uplifted edges of the curved planes, and buoy it up so that it will\\nrise in the air and take you with it.', 'This rise will not be great, just\\nenough to keep you well clear of the ground.', 'Now project your legs a\\nlittle to the front so as to shift the center of gravity a trifle and\\nbring the edges of the glider on an exact level with the atmosphere.', 'This, with the momentum acquired in the start, will keep the machine\\nmoving forward for some distance.', 'Effect of Body Movements.', 'When the weight of the body is slightly back of the center of gravity\\nthe edges of the advancing planes are tilted slightly upward.', 'The glider\\nin this position acts as a scoop, taking in the air which, in turn,\\nlifts it off the ground.', 'When a certain altitude is reached--this varies\\nwith the force of the wind--the tendency to a forward movement is\\nlost and the glider comes to the ground.', 'It is to prolong the forward\\nmovement as much as possible that the operator shifts the center of\\ngravity slightly, bringing the apparatus on an even keel as it were by\\nlowering the advancing edges.', 'This done, so long as there is momentum\\nenough to keep the glider moving, it will remain afloat.', 'If you shift your body well forward it will bring the front edges of\\nthe glider down, and elevate the rear ones.', 'In this way the air will be\\n\"spilled\" out at the rear, and, having lost the air support or buoyancy,\\nthe glider comes down to the ground.', 'A few flights will make any\\nordinary man proficient in the control of his apparatus by his body\\nmovements, not only as concerns the elevating and depressing of the\\nadvancing edges, but also actual steering.', 'You will quickly learn,\\nfor instance, that, as the shifting of the bodily weight backwards\\nand forwards affects the upward and downward trend of the planes, so a\\nmovement sideways--to the left or the right--affects the direction in\\nwhich the glider travels.', 'Ascends at an Angle.', 'In ascending, the glider and flying machine, like the bird, makes an\\nangular, not a vertical flight.', 'Just what this angle of ascension may be\\nis difficult to determine.', 'It is probable and in fact altogether likely,\\nthat it varies with the force of the wind, weight of the rising body,\\npower of propulsion, etc.', 'This, in the language of physicists, is the\\nangle of inclination, and, as a general thing, under normal conditions\\n(still air) should be put down as about one in ten, or 5 3/4 degrees.', 'This would be an ideal condition, but it has not, as vet been reached.', 'The force of the wind affects the angle considerably, as does also the\\nweight and velocity of the apparatus.', 'In general practice the angle\\nvaries from 23 to 45 degrees.', 'At more than 45 degrees the supporting\\neffort is overcome by the resistance to forward motion.', 'Increasing the speed or propulsive force, tends to lessen the angle at\\nwhich the machine may be successfully operated because it reduces the\\nwind pressure.', 'Most of the modern flying machines are operated at an\\nangle of 23 degrees, or less.', 'Maintaining an Equilibrium.', 'Stable equilibrium is one of the main essentials to successful flight,\\nand this cannot be preserved in an uncertain, gusty wind, especially by\\nan amateur.', 'The novice should not attempt a glide unless the conditions\\nare just right.', 'These conditions are: A clear, level space, without\\nobstructions, such as trees, etc., and a steady wind of not exceeding\\ntwelve miles an hour.', 'Always fly against the wind.', 'When a reasonable amount of proficiency in the handling of the machine\\non level ground has been acquired the field of practice may be changed\\nto some gentle slope.', 'In starting from a slope it will be found easier\\nto keep the machine afloat, but the experience at first is likely to be\\nvery disconcerting to a man of less than iron nerve.', 'As the glider sails\\naway from the top of the slope the distance between him and the ground\\nincreases rapidly until the aviator thinks he is up a hundred miles\\nin the air.', 'If he will keep cool, manipulate his apparatus so as to\\npreserve its equilibrium, and \"let nature take its course,\" he will come\\ndown gradually and safely to the ground at a considerable distance\\nfrom the starting place.', 'This is one advantage of starting from an\\nelevation--your machine will go further.', 'But, if the aviator becomes \"rattled\"; if he loses control of his\\nmachine, serious results, including a bad fall with risk of death,\\nare almost certain.', 'And yet this practice is just as necessary as the\\ninitial lessons on level ground.', 'When judgment is used, and \"haste made\\nslowly,\" there is very little real danger.', 'While experimenting with\\ngliders the Wrights made flights innumerable under all sorts of\\nconditions and never had an accident of any kind.', 'Effects of Wind Currents.', 'The larger the machine the more difficult it will be to control its\\nmovements in the air, and yet enlargement is absolutely necessary as\\nweight, in the form of motor, rudder, etc., is added.', 'Air currents near the surface of the ground are diverted by every\\nobstruction unless the wind is blowing hard enough to remove the\\nobstruction entirely.', 'Take, for instance, the case of a tree or shrub,\\nin a moderate wind of from ten to twelve miles an hour.', 'As the wind\\nstrikes the tree it divides, part going to one side and part going to\\nthe other, while still another part is directed upward and goes over\\nthe top of the obstruction.', 'This makes the handling of a glider on\\nan obstructed field difficult and uncertain.', 'To handle a glider\\nsuccessfully the place of operation should be clear and the wind\\nmoderate and steady.', 'If it is gusty postpone your flight.', 'In this\\nconnection it will be well to understand the velocity of the wind, and\\nwhat it means as shown in the following table:\\n\\n     Miles per hour Feet per second     Pressure per sq.', 'foot\\n          10                14.7                .492\\n          25                36.7                3.075\\n          50                73.3               12.300\\n          100              146.6               49.200\\n\\nPressure of wind increases in proportion to the square of the velocity.', 'Thus wind at 10 miles an hour has four times the pressure of wind at\\n5 miles an hour.', 'The greater this pressure the large and heavier the\\nobject which can be raised.', 'Any boy who has had experience in flying\\nkites can testify to this, High winds, however, are almost invariably\\ngusty and uncertain as to direction, and this makes them dangerous for\\naviators.', 'It is also a self-evident fact that, beyond a certain stage,\\nthe harder the wind blows the more difficult it is to make headway\\nagainst it.', 'Launching Device for Gliders.', 'On page 195 will be found a diagram of the various parts of a launcher\\nfor gliders, designed and patented by Mr.', 'Octave Chanute.', 'In describing\\nthis invention in Aeronautics, Mr. Chanute says:\\n\\n\"In practicing, the track, preferably portable, is generally laid in\\nthe direction of the existing wind and the car, preferably a\\nlight platform-car, is placed on the track.', 'The truck carrying\\nthe winding-drum and its motor is placed to windward a suitable\\ndistance--say from two hundred to one thousand feet--and is firmly\\nblocked or anchored in line with the portable track, which is preferably\\n80 or 100 feet in length.', 'The flying or gliding machine to be launched\\nwith its operator is placed on the platform-car at the leeward end of\\nthe portable track.', 'The line, which is preferably a flexible combination\\nwire-and-cord cable, is stretched between the winding-drum on the track\\nand detachably secured to the flying or gliding machine, preferably by\\nmeans of a trip-hoop, or else held in the hand of the operator, so that\\nthe operator may readily detach the same from the flying-machine when\\nthe desired height is attained.\"', 'How Glider Is Started.', '\"Then upon a signal given by the operator the engineer at the motor\\nputs it into operation, gradually increasing the speed until the line\\nis wound upon the drum at a maximum speed of, say, thirty miles an\\nhour.', 'The operator of the flying-machine, whether he stands upright and\\ncarries it on his shoulders, or whether he sits or lies down prone upon\\nit, adjusts the aeroplane or carrying surfaces so that the wind shall\\nstrike them on the top and press downward instead of upward until the\\nplatform-car under action of the winding-drum and line attains the\\nrequired speed.', '\"When the operator judges that his speed is sufficient, and this depends\\nupon the velocity of the wind as well as that of the car moving against\\nthe wind, he quickly causes the front of the flying-machine to tip\\nupward, so that the relative wind striking on the under side of the\\nplanes or carrying surfaces shall lift the flying machine into the air.', 'It then ascends like a kite to such height as may be desired by the\\noperator, who then trips the hook and releases the line from the\\nmachine.\"', 'What the Operator Does.', '\"The operator being now free in the air has a certain initial velocity\\nimparted by the winding-drum and line and also a potential energy\\ncorresponding to his height above the ground.', 'If the flying or gliding\\nmachine is provided with a motor, he can utilize that in his further\\nflight, and if it is a simple gliding machine without motor he can make\\na descending flight through the air to such distance as corresponds to\\nthe velocity acquired and the height gained, steering meanwhile by the\\ndevices provided for that purpose.', '\"The simplest operation or maneuver is to continue the flight straight\\nahead against the wind; but it is possible to vary this course to the\\nright or left, or even to return in downward flight with the wind to\\nthe vicinity of the starting-point.', 'Upon nearing the ground the operator\\ntips upward his carrying-surfaces and stops his headway upon the\\ncushion of increased air resistance so caused.', 'The operator is in no way\\npermanently fastened to his machine, and the machine and the operator\\nsimply rest upon the light platform-car, so that the operator is free\\nto rise with the machine from the car whenever the required initial\\nvelocity is attained.', 'Motor For the Launcher.', '\"The motor may be of any suitable kind or construction, but is\\npreferably an electric or gasolene motor.', 'The winding-drum is furnished\\nwith any suitable or customary reversing-guide to cause the line to\\nwind smoothly and evenly upon the drum.', 'The line is preferably a cable\\ncomposed of flexible wire and having a cotton or other cord core to\\nincrease its flexibility.', 'The line extends from the drum to the flying\\nor gliding machine.', 'Its free end may, if desired, be grasped and held\\nby the operator until the flying-machine ascends to the desired height,\\nwhen by simply letting go of the line the operator may continue his\\nflight free.', 'The line, however, is preferably connected to the flying\\nor gliding machine directly by a trip-hook having a handle or trip lever\\nwithin reach of the operator, so that when he ascends to the required\\nheight he may readily detach the line from the flying or gliding\\nmachine.\"', 'CHAPTER VII.', 'PUTTING ON THE RUDDER.', 'Gliders as a rule have only one rudder, and this is in the rear.', 'It\\ntends to keep the apparatus with its head to the wind.', 'Unlike the rudder\\non a boat it is fixed and immovable.', 'The real motor-propelled flying\\nmachine, generally has both front and rear rudders manipulated by wire\\ncables at the will of the operator.', 'Allowing that the amateur has become reasonably expert in the\\nmanipulation of the glider he should, before constructing an actual\\nflying machine, equip his glider with a rudder.', 'Cross Pieces for Rudder Beam.', 'To do this he should begin by putting in a cross piece, 2 feet long by\\n1/4 x 3/4 inches between the center struts, in the lower plane.', 'This may\\nbe fastened to the struts with bolts or braces.', 'The former method is\\npreferable.', 'On this cross piece, and on the rear frame of the plane\\nitself, the rudder beam is clamped and bolted.', 'This rudder beam is 8\\nfeet 11 inches long.', 'Having put these in place duplicate them in exactly\\nthe same manner and dimensions from the upper frame The cross pieces on\\nwhich the ends of the rudder beams are clamped should be placed about\\none foot in advance of the rear frame beam.', 'The Rudder Itself.', 'The next step is to construct the rudder itself.', 'This consists of two\\nsections, one horizontal, the other vertical.', 'The latter keeps\\nthe aeroplane headed into the wind, while the former keeps it\\nsteady--preserves the equilibrium.', 'The rudder beams form the top and bottom frames of the vertical rudder.', 'To these are bolted and clamped two upright pieces, 3 feet, 10 inches\\nin length, and 3/4 inch in cross section.', 'These latter pieces are placed\\nabout two feet apart.', 'This completes the framework of the vertical\\nrudder.', 'See next page (59).', 'For the horizontal rudder you will require two strips 6 feet long, and\\nfour 2 feet long.', 'Find the exact center of the upright pieces on the\\nvertical rudder, and at this spot fasten with bolts the long pieces of\\nthe horizontal, placing them on the outside of the vertical strips.', 'Next\\njoin the ends of the horizontal strips with the 2-foot pieces, using\\nsmall screws and corner braces.', 'This done you will have two of the\\n2-foot pieces left.', 'These go in the center of the horizontal frame,\\n\"straddling\" the vertical strips, as shown in the illustration.', 'The framework is to be covered with cloth in the same manner as the\\nplanes.', 'For this about ten yards will be needed.', 'Strengthening the Rudder.', 'To ensure rigidity the rudder must be stayed with guy wires.', 'For this\\npurpose the No.', '12 piano wire is the best.', 'Begin by running two of these\\nwires from the top eye-bolts of stanchions 3 and 4, page 37, to rudder\\nbeam where it joins the rudder planes, fastening them at the bottom.', 'Then run two wires from the top of the rudder beam at the same point,\\nto the bottom eye-bolts of the same stanchions.', 'This will give you\\nfour diagonal wires reaching from the rudder beam to the top and bottom\\nplanes of the glider.', 'Now, from the outer ends of the rudder frame run\\nfour similar diagonal wires to the end of the rudder beam where it rests\\non the cross piece.', 'You will then have eight truss wires strengthening\\nthe connection of the rudder to the main body of the glider.', 'The framework of the rudder planes is then to be braced in the same way,\\nwhich will take eight more wires, four for each rudder plane.', 'All the\\nwires are to be connected at one end with turn-buckles so the tension\\nmay be regulated as desired.', 'In forming the rudder frame it will be well to mortise the corners, tack\\nthem together with small nails, and then put in a corner brace in the\\ninside of each joint.', 'In doing this bear in mind that the material to be\\nthus fastened is light, and consequently the lightest of nails, screws,\\nbolts and corner pieces, etc., is necessary.', 'CHAPTER VIII.', 'THE REAL FLYING MACHINE.', 'We will now assume that you have become proficient enough to warrant an\\nattempt at the construction of a real flying machine--one that will not\\nonly remain suspended in the air at the will of the operator, but make\\nrespectable progress in whatever direction he may desire to go.', 'The\\nglider, it must be remembered, is not steerable, except to a limited\\nextent, and moves only in one direction--against the wind.', 'Besides this\\nits power of flotation--suspension in the air--is circumscribed.', 'Larger Surface Area Required.', 'The real flying machine is the glider enlarged, and equipped with\\nmotor and propeller.', 'The first thing to do is to decide upon the size\\nrequired.', 'While a glider of 20 foot spread is large enough to sustain a\\nman it could not under any possible conditions, be made to rise with the\\nweight of the motor, propeller and similar equipment added.', 'As the load\\nis increased so must the surface area of the planes be increased.', 'Just what this increase in surface area should be is problematical as\\nexperienced aviators disagree, but as a general proposition it may be\\nplaced at from three to four times the area of a 20-foot glider.', '[3]\\n\\nSome Practical Examples.', 'The Wrights used a biplane 41 feet in spread, and 6 1/2 ft. deep.', 'This,\\nfor the two planes, gives a total surface area of 538 square feet,\\ninclusive of auxiliary planes.', 'This sustains the engine equipment,\\noperator, etc., a total weight officially announced at 1,070 pounds.', 'It\\nshows a lifting capacity of about two pounds to the square foot of plane\\nsurface, as against a lifting capacity of about 1/2 pound per square\\nfoot of plane surface for the 20-foot glider.', 'This same Wright machine\\nis also reported to have made a successful flight, carrying a total load\\nof 1,100 pounds, which would be over two pounds for each square foot of\\nsurface area, which, with auxiliary planes, is 538 square feet.', 'To attain the same results in a monoplane, the single surface would\\nhave to be 60 feet in spread and 9 feet deep.', 'But, while this is the\\nmathematical rule, Bleriot has demonstrated that it does not always hold\\ngood.', 'On his record-breaking trip across the English channel, July 25th,\\n1909, the Frenchman was carried in a monoplane 24 1/2 feet in spread,\\nand with a total sustaining surface of 150 1/2 square feet.', 'The total\\nweight of the outfit, including machine, operator and fuel sufficient\\nfor a three-hour run, was only 660 pounds.', 'With an engine of (nominally)\\n25 horsepower the distance of 21 miles was covered in 37 minutes.', 'Which is the Best?', 'Right here an established mathematical quantity is involved.', 'A small\\nplane surface offers less resistance to the air than a large one and\\nconsequently can attain a higher rate of speed.', 'As explained further\\non in this chapter speed is an important factor in the matter of\\nweight-sustaining capacity.', 'A machine that travels one-third faster\\nthan another can get along with one-half the surface area of the latter\\nwithout affecting the load.', 'See the closing paragraph of this chapter on\\nthis point.', 'In theory the construction is also the simplest, but this is\\nnot always found to be so in practice.', 'The designing and carrying\\ninto execution of plans for an extensive area like that of a monoplane\\ninvolves great skill and cleverness in getting a framework that will be\\nstrong enough to furnish the requisite support without an undue excess\\nof weight.', 'This proposition is greatly simplified in the biplane and,\\nwhile the speed attained by the latter may not be quite so great as that\\nof the monoplane, it has much larger weight-carrying capacity.', 'Proper Sizes For Frame.', 'Allowing that the biplane form is selected the construction may be\\npractically identical with that of the 20-foot glider described in\\nChapter V., except as to size and elimination of the armpieces.', 'In\\nsize the surface planes should be about twice as large as those of\\nthe 20-foot glider, viz: 40 feet spread instead of 20, and 6 feet deep\\ninstead of 3.', 'The horizontal beams, struts, stanchions, ribs, etc.,\\nshould also be increased in size proportionately.', 'While care in the selection of clear, straight-grained timber is\\nimportant in the glider, it is still more important in the construction\\nof a motor-equipped flying machine as the strain on the various parts\\nwill be much greater.', 'How to Splice Timbers.', 'It is practically certain that you will have to resort to splicing the\\nhorizontal beams as it will be difficult, if not impossible, to find\\n40-foot pieces of timber totally free from knots and worm holes, and of\\nstraight grain.', 'If splicing is necessary select two good 20-foot pieces, 3 inches wide\\nand 1 1/2 inches thick, and one 10-foot long, of the same thickness and\\nwidth.', 'Plane off the bottom sides of the 10-foot strip, beginning about\\ntwo feet back from each end, and taper them so the strip will be about\\n3/4 inch thick at the extreme ends.', 'Lay the two 20-foot beams end to\\nend, and under the joint thus made place the 10-foot strip, with the\\nplaned-off ends downward.', 'The joint of the 20-foot pieces should be\\ndirectly in the center of the 10-foot piece.', 'Bore ten holes (with a\\n1/4-inch augur) equi-distant apart through the 20-foot strips and the\\n10-foot strip under them.', 'Through these holes run 1/4-inch stove bolts\\nwith round, beveled heads.', 'In placing these bolts use washers top and\\nbottom, one between the head and the top beam, and the other between the\\nbottom beam and the screw nut which holds the bolt.', 'Screw the nuts down\\nhard so as to bring the two beams tightly together, and you will have a\\nrigid 40-foot beam.', 'Splicing with Metal Sleeves.', 'An even better way of making a splice is by tonguing and grooving the\\nends of the frame pieces and enclosing them in a metal sleeve, but\\nit requires more mechanical skill than the method first named.', 'The\\noperation of tonguing and grooving is especially delicate and calls for\\nextreme nicety of touch in the handling of tools, but if this dexterity\\nis possessed the job will be much more satisfactory than one done with a\\nthird timber.', 'As the frame pieces are generally about 1 1/2 inch in diameter, the\\ntongue and the groove into which the tongue fits must be correspondingly\\nsmall.', 'Begin by sawing into one side of one of the frame pieces about\\n4 inches back from the end.', 'Make the cut about 1/2 inch deep.', 'Then turn\\nthe piece over and duplicate the cut.', 'Next saw down from the end\\nto these cuts.', 'When the sawed-out parts are removed you will have a\\n\"tongue\" in the end of the frame timber 4 inches long and 1/2 inch\\nthick.', 'The next move is to saw out a 5/8-inch groove in the end of the\\nframe piece which is to be joined.', 'You will have to use a small chisel\\nto remove the 5/8-inch bit.', 'This will leave a groove into which the\\ntongue will fit easily.', 'Joining the Two Pieces.', 'Take a thin metal sleeve--this is merely a hollow tube of aluminum\\nor brass open at each end--8 inches long, and slip it over either the\\ntongued or grooved end of one of the frame timbers.', 'It is well to have\\nthe sleeve fit snugly, and this may necessitate a sand-papering of the\\nframe pieces so the sleeve will slip on.', 'Push the sleeve well back out of the way.', 'Cover the tongue thoroughly\\nwith glue, and also put some on the inside of the groove.', 'Use plenty\\nof glue.', 'Now press the tongue into the groove, and keep the ends firmly\\ntogether until the glue is thoroughly dried.', 'Rub off the joint lightly\\nwith sand-paper to remove any of the glue which may have oozed out, and\\nslip the sleeve into place over the joint.', 'Tack the sleeve in position\\nwith small copper tacks, and you will have an ideal splice.', 'The same operation is to be repeated on each of the four frame pieces.', 'Two 20-foot pieces joined in this way will give a substantial frame, but\\nwhen suitable timber of this kind can not be had, three pieces, each 6\\nfeet 11 inches long, may be used.', 'This would give 20 feet 9 inches, of\\nwhich 8 inches will be taken up in the two joints, leaving the frame 20\\nfeet 1 inch long.', 'Installation of Motor.', 'Next comes the installation of the motor.', 'The kinds and efficiency of\\nthe various types are described in the following chapter (IX).', 'All we\\nare interested in at this point is the manner of installation.', 'This\\nvaries according to the personal ideas of the aviator.', 'Thus one man puts\\nhis motor in the front of his machine, another places it in the center,\\nand still another finds the rear of the frame the best.', 'All get\\ngood results, the comparative advantages of which it is difficult\\nto estimate.', 'Where one man, as already explained, flies faster than\\nanother, the one beaten from the speed standpoint has an advantage in\\nthe matter of carrying weight, etc.', 'The ideas of various well-known aviators as to the correct placing of\\nmotors may be had from the following:\\n\\nWrights--In rear of machine and to one side.', 'Curtiss--Well to rear, about midway between upper and lower planes.', 'Raich--In rear, above the center.', 'Brauner-Smith--In exact center of machine.', 'Van Anden--In center.', 'Herring-Burgess--Directly behind operator.', 'Voisin--In rear, and on lower plane.', 'Bleriot--In front.', 'R. E. P.--In front.', 'The One Chief Object.', 'An even distribution of the load so as to assist in maintaining the\\nequilibrium of the machine, should be the one chief object in deciding\\nupon the location of the motor.', 'It matters little what particular spot\\nis selected so long as the weight does not tend to overbalance the\\nmachine, or to \"throw it off an even keel.\"', 'It is just like loading\\na vessel, an operation in which the expert seeks to so distribute\\nthe weight of the cargo as to keep the vessel in a perfectly upright\\nposition, and prevent a \"list\" or leaning to one side.', 'The more evenly\\nthe cargo is distributed the more perfect will be the equilibrium of the\\nvessel and the better it can be handled.', 'Sometimes, when not properly\\nstowed, the cargo shifts, and this at once affects the position of the\\ncraft.', 'When a ship \"lists\" to starboard or port a preponderating weight\\nof the cargo has shifted sideways; if bow or stern is unduly depressed\\nit is a sure indication that the cargo has shifted accordingly.', 'In\\neither event the handling of the craft becomes not only difficult, but\\nextremely hazardous.', 'Exactly the same conditions prevail in the handling\\nof a flying machine.', 'Shape of Machine a Factor.', 'In placing the motor you must be governed largely by the shape and\\nconstruction of the flying machine frame.', 'If the bulk of the weight\\nof the machine and auxiliaries is toward the rear, then the natural\\nlocation for the motor will be well to the front so as to counterbalance\\nthe excess in rear weight.', 'In the same way if the preponderance of the\\nweight is forward, then the motor should be placed back of the center.', 'As the propeller blade is really an integral part of the motor, the\\nlatter being useless without it, its placing naturally depends upon the\\nlocation selected for the motor.', 'Rudders and Auxiliary Planes.', 'Here again there is great diversity of opinion among aviators as to\\nsize, location and form.', 'The striking difference of ideas in this\\nrespect is well illustrated in the choice made by prominent makers as\\nfollows:\\n\\nVoisin--horizontal rudder, with two wing-like planes, in front; box-like\\nlongitudinal stability plane in rear, inside of which is a vertical\\nrudder.', 'Wright--large biplane horizontal rudder in front at considerable\\ndistance--about 10 feet--from the main planes; vertical biplane rudder\\nin rear; ends of upper and lower main planes made flexible so they may\\nbe moved.', 'Curtiss--horizontal biplane rudder, with vertical damping plane between\\nthe rudder planes about 10 feet in front of main planes; vertical rudder\\nin rear; stabilizing planes at each end of upper main plane.', 'Bleriot--V-shaped stabilizing fin, projecting from rear of plane, with\\nbroad end outward; to the broad end of this fin is hinged a vertical\\nrudder; horizontal biplane rudder, also in rear, under the fin.', 'These instances show forcefully the wide diversity of opinion existing\\namong experienced aviators as to the best manner of placing the rudders\\nand stabilizing, or auxiliary planes, and make manifest how hopeless\\nwould be the task of attempting to select any one form and advise its\\nexclusive use.', 'Rudder and Auxiliary Construction.', 'The material used in the construction of the rudders and auxiliary\\nplanes is the same as that used in the main planes--spruce for the\\nframework and some kind of rubberized or varnished cloth for the\\ncovering.', 'The frames are joined and wired in exactly the same manner\\nas the frames of the main planes, the purpose being to secure the same\\nstrength and rigidity.', 'Dimensions of the various parts depend upon the\\nplan adopted and the size of the main plane.', 'No details as to exact dimensions of these rudders and auxiliary planes\\nare obtainable.', 'The various builders, while willing enough to supply\\ndata as to the general measurements, weight, power, etc., of their\\nmachines, appear to have overlooked the details of the auxiliary parts,\\nthinking, perhaps, that these were of no particular import to the\\ngeneral public.', 'In the Wright machine, the rear horizontal and front\\nvertical rudders may be set down as being about one-quarter (probably a\\nlittle less) the size of the main supporting planes.', 'Arrangement of Alighting Gear.', 'Most modern machines are equipped with an alighting gear, which not\\nonly serves to protect the machine and aviator from shock or injury in\\ntouching the ground, but also aids in getting under headway.', 'All the\\nleading makes, with the exception of the Wright, are furnished with a\\nframe carrying from two to five pneumatic rubber-tired bicycle wheels.', 'In the Curtiss and Voisin machines one wheel is placed in front and two\\nin the rear.', 'In the Bleriot and other prominent machines the reverse is\\nthe rule--two wheels in front and one in the rear.', 'Farman makes use of\\nfive wheels, one in the extreme rear, and four, arranged in pairs, a\\nlittle to the front of the center of the main lower plane.', 'In place of wheels the Wright machine is equipped with a skid-like\\ndevice consisting of two long beams attached to the lower plane by\\nstanchions and curving up far in front, so as to act as supports to the\\nhorizontal rudder.', 'Why Wood Is Favored.', 'A frequently asked question is: \"Why is not aluminum, or some similar\\nmetal, substituted for wood.\"', 'Wood, particularly spruce, is preferred\\nbecause, weight considered, it is much stronger than aluminum, and this\\nis the lightest of all metals.', 'In this connection the following table\\nwill be of interest:\\n\\n

tensile\\nstrength, is the great essential in flying-machine construction, it can\\nbe readily seen that the use of metal, even aluminum, for the framework,\\nis prohibited by its weight.', 'While aluminum has double the strength\\nof spruce wood it is vastly heavier, and thus the advantage it has in\\nstrength is overbalanced many times by its weight.', 'The specific gravity\\nof aluminum is 2.50; that of spruce is only 0.403.', 'Things to Be Considered.', 'In laying out plans for a flying machine there are five important points\\nwhich should be settled upon before the actual work of construction is\\nstarted.', 'These are:\\n\\nFirst--Approximate weight of the machine when finished and equipped.', 'Second--Area of the supporting surface required.', 'Third--Amount of power that will be necessary to secure the desired\\nspeed and lifting capacity.', 'Fourth--Exact dimensions of the main framework and of the auxiliary\\nparts.', 'Fifth--Size, speed and character of the propeller.', 'In deciding upon these it will be well to take into consideration\\nthe experience of expert aviators regarding these features as given\\nelsewhere.', '(See Chapter X.)', 'Estimating the Weights Involved.', 'In fixing upon the probable approximate weight in advance of\\nconstruction much, of course, must be assumed.', 'This means that it will\\nbe a matter of advance estimating.', 'If a two-passenger machine is to be\\nbuilt we will start by assuming the maximum combined weight of the two\\npeople to be 350 pounds.', 'Most of the professional aviators are lighter\\nthan this.', 'Taking the medium between the weights of the Curtiss and\\nWright machines we have a net average of 850 pounds for the framework,\\nmotor, propeller, etc.', 'This, with the two passengers, amounts to 1,190\\npounds.', 'As the machines quoted are in successful operation it will be\\nreasonable to assume that this will be a safe basis to operate on.', 'What the Novice Must Avoid.', 'This does not mean, however, that it will be safe to follow these\\nweights exactly in construction, but that they will serve merely as\\na basis to start from.', 'Because an expert can turn out a machine,\\nthoroughly equipped, of 850 pounds weight, it does not follow that a\\nnovice can do the same thing.', \"The expert's work is the result of years\\nof experience, and he has learned how to construct frames and motor\\nplants of the utmost lightness and strength.\", 'It will be safer for the novice to assume that he can not duplicate the\\nwork of such men as Wright and Curtiss without adding materially to the\\ngross weight of the framework and equipment minus passengers.', 'How to Distribute the Weight.', 'Let us take 1,030 pounds as the net weight of the machine as against the\\nsame average in the Wright and Curtiss machines.', 'Now comes the question\\nof distributing this weight between the framework, motor, and other\\nequipment.', 'As a general proposition the framework should weigh about\\ntwice as much as the complete power plant (this is for amateur work).', 'The word \"framework\" indicates not only the wooden frames of the main\\nplanes, auxiliary planes, rudders, etc., but the cloth coverings as\\nwell--everything in fact except the engine and propeller.', 'On the basis named the framework would weigh 686 pounds, and the power\\nplant 344.', 'These figures are liberal, and the results desired may be\\nobtained well within them as the novice will learn as he makes progress\\nin the work.', 'Figuring on Surface Area.', 'It was Prof. Langley who first brought into prominence in connection\\nwith flying machine construction the mathematical principle that the\\nlarger the object the smaller may be the relative area of support.', 'As\\nexplained in Chapter XIII, there are mechanical limits as to size which\\nit is not practical to exceed, but the main principle remains in effect.', 'Take two aeroplanes of marked difference in area of surface.', 'The larger\\nwill, as a rule, sustain a greater weight in relative proportion to\\nits area than the smaller one, and do the work with less relative\\nhorsepower.', 'As a general thing well-constructed machines will average\\na supporting capacity of one pound for every one-half square foot of\\nsurface area.', 'Accepting this as a working rule we find that to sustain\\na weight of 1,200 pounds--machine and two passengers--we should have 600\\nsquare feet of surface.', 'Distributing the Surface Area.', 'The largest surfaces now in use are those of the Wright, Voisin and\\nAntoinette machines--538 square feet in each.', 'The actual sustaining\\npower of these machines, so far as known, has never been tested to the\\nlimit; it is probable that the maximum is considerably in excess of what\\nthey have been called upon to show.', 'In actual practice the average is a\\nlittle over one pound for each one-half square foot of surface area.', 'Allowing that 600 square feet of surface will be used, the next question\\nis how to distribute it to the best advantage.', 'This is another important\\nmatter in which individual preference must rule.', 'We have seen how the\\nprofessionals disagree on this point, some using auxiliary planes\\nof large size, and others depending upon smaller auxiliaries with an\\nincrease in number so as to secure on a different plan virtually the\\nsame amount of surface.', 'In deciding upon this feature the best thing to do is to follow the\\nplans of some successful aviator, increasing the area of the auxiliaries\\nin proportion to the increase in the area of the main planes.', 'Thus, if\\nyou use 600 square feet of surface where the man whose plans you\\nare following uses 500, it is simply a matter of making your planes\\none-fifth larger all around.', 'The Cost of Production.', 'Cost of production will be of interest to the amateur who essays to\\nconstruct a flying machine.', 'Assuming that the size decided upon is\\ndouble that of the glider the material for the framework, timber, cloth,\\nwire, etc., will cost a little more than double.', 'This is because it must\\nbe heavier in proportion to the increased size of the framework, and\\nheavy material brings a larger price than the lighter goods.', 'If we allow\\n$20 as the cost of the glider material it will be safe to put down\\nthe cost of that required for a real flying machine framework at $60,\\nprovided the owner builds it himself.', 'As regards the cost of motor and similar equipment it can only be said\\nthat this depends upon the selection made.', 'There are some reliable\\naviation motors which may be had as low as $500, and there are others\\nwhich cost as much as $2,000.', 'Services of Expert Necessary.', 'No matter what kind of a motor may be selected the services of an expert\\nwill be necessary in its proper installation unless the amateur has\\nconsiderable genius in this line himself.', 'As a general thing $25 should\\nbe a liberal allowance for this work.', 'No matter how carefully the engine\\nmay be placed and connected it will be largely a matter of luck if it is\\ninstalled in exactly the proper manner at the first attempt.', 'The chances\\nare that several alterations, prompted by the results of trials, will\\nhave to be made.', \"If this is the case the expert's bill may readily run\\nup to $50.\", 'If the amateur is competent to do this part of the work the\\nentire item of $50 may, of course, be cut out.', 'As a general proposition a fairly satisfactory flying machine, one that\\nwill actually fly and carry the operator with it, may be constructed for\\n$750, but it will lack the better qualities which mark the higher priced\\nmachines.', 'This computation is made on the basis of $60 for material, $50\\nfor services of expert, $600 for motor, etc., and an allowance of $40\\nfor extras.', 'No man who has the flying machine germ in his system will be long\\nsatisfied with his first moderate price machine, no matter how well it\\nmay work.', 'It\\'s the old story of the automobile \"bug\" over again.', 'The man\\nwho starts in with a modest $1,000 automobile invariably progresses by\\neasy stages to the $4,000 or $5,000 class.', 'The natural tendency is to\\nwant the biggest and best attainable within the financial reach of the\\nowner.', \"It's exactly the same way with the flying machine convert.\", 'The more\\nproficient he becomes in the manipulation of his car, the stronger\\nbecomes the desire to fly further and stay in the air longer than the\\nrest of his brethren.', 'This necessitates larger, more powerful, and more\\nexpensive machines as the work of the germ progresses.', 'Speed Affects Weight Capacity.', \"Don't overlook the fact that the greater speed you can attain the\\nsmaller will be the surface area you can get along with.\", 'If a machine\\nwith 500 square feet of sustaining surface, traveling at a speed of\\n40 miles an hour, will carry a weight of 1,200 pounds, we can cut the\\nsustaining surface in half and get along with 250 square feet, provided\\na speed of 60 miles an hour can be obtained.', 'At 100 miles an hour only\\n80 square feet of surface area would be required.', 'In both instances the\\nweight sustaining capacity will remain the same as with the 500 square\\nfeet of surface area--1,200 pounds.', 'One of these days some mathematical genius will figure out this problem\\nwith exactitude and we will have a dependable table giving the maximum\\ncarrying capacity of various surface areas at various stated speeds,\\nbased on the dimensions of the advancing edges.', 'At present it is largely\\na matter of guesswork so far as making accurate computation goes.', 'Much depends upon the shape of the machine, and the amount of surface\\noffering resistance to the wind, etc.', 'CHAPTER IX.', 'SELECTION OF THE MOTOR.', 'Motors for flying machines must be light in weight, of great strength,\\nproductive of extreme speed, and positively dependable in action.', 'It matters little as to the particular form, or whether air or water\\ncooled, so long as the four features named are secured.', 'There are at\\nleast a dozen such motors or engines now in use.', 'All are of the gasolene\\ntype, and all possess in greater or lesser degree the desired qualities.', 'Some of these motors are:\\n\\nRenault--8-cylinder, air-cooled; 50 horse power; weight 374 pounds.', 'Fiat--8-cylinder, air-cooled; 50 horse power; weight 150 pounds.', 'Farcot--8-cylinder, air-cooled; from 30 to 100 horse power, according to\\nbore of cylinders; weight of smallest, 84 pounds.', 'R. E. P.--10-cylinder, air-cooled; 150 horse power; weight 215 pounds.', 'Gnome--7 and 14 cylinders, revolving type, air-cooled; 50 and 100 horse\\npower; weight 150 and 300 pounds.', 'Darracq--2 to 14 cylinders, water cooled; 30 to 200 horse power; weight\\nof smallest 100 pounds.', 'Wright--4-cylinder, water-cooled; 25 horse power; weight 200 pounds.', 'Antoinette--8 and 16-cylinder, water-cooled; 50 and 100 horse power;\\nweight 250 and 500 pounds.', 'E. N. V.--8-cylinder, water-cooled; from 30 to 80 horse power, according\\nto bore of cylinder; weight 150 to 400 pounds.', 'Curtiss--8-cylinder, water-cooled; 60 horse power; weight 300 pounds.', 'Average Weight Per Horse Power.', 'It will be noticed that the Gnome motor is unusually light, being about\\nthree pounds to the horse power produced, as opposed to an average of 4\\n1/2 pounds per horse power in other makes.', 'This result is secured by\\nthe elimination of the fly-wheel, the engine itself revolving, thus\\nobtaining the same effect that would be produced by a fly-wheel.', 'The\\nFarcot is even lighter, being considerably less than three pounds per\\nhorse power, which is the nearest approach to the long-sought engine\\nequipment that will make possible a complete flying machine the total\\nweight of which will not exceed one pound per square foot of area.', 'How Lightness Is Secured.', 'Thus far foreign manufacturers are ahead of Americans in the production\\nof light-weight aerial motors, as is evidenced by the Gnome and Farcot\\nengines, both of which are of French make.', 'Extreme lightness is made\\npossible by the use of fine, specially prepared steel for the cylinders,\\nthus permitting them to be much thinner than if ordinary forms of steel\\nwere used.', 'Another big saving in weight is made by substituting what are\\nknown as \"auto lubricating\" alloys for bearings.', 'These alloys are made\\nof a combination of aluminum and magnesium.', 'Still further gains are made in the use of alloy steel tubing instead of\\nsolid rods, and also by the paring away of material wherever it can be\\ndone without sacrificing strength.', 'This plan, with the exclusive use of\\nthe best grades of steel, regardless of cost, makes possible a marked\\nreduction in weight.', 'Multiplicity of Cylinders.', 'Strange as it may seem, multiplicity of cylinders does not always add\\nproportionate weight.', 'Because a 4-cylinder motor weighs say 100 pounds,\\nit does not necessarily follow that an 8-cylinder equipment will weigh\\n200 pounds.', 'The reason of this will be plain when it is understood\\nthat many of the parts essential to a 4-cylinder motor will fill the\\nrequirements of an 8-cylinder motor without enlargement or addition.', 'Neither does multiplying the cylinders always increase the horsepower\\nproportionately.', 'If a 4-cylinder motor is rated at 25 horsepower it is\\nnot safe to take it for granted that double the number of cylinders\\nwill give 50 horsepower.', 'Generally speaking, eight cylinders, the bore,\\nstroke and speed being the same, will give double the power that can be\\nobtained from four, but this does not always hold good.', 'Just why this\\nexception should occur is not explainable by any accepted rule.', 'Horse Power and Speed.', 'Speed is an important requisite in a flying-machine motor, as the\\nvelocity of the aeroplane is a vital factor in flotation.', 'At\\nfirst thought, the propeller and similar adjuncts being equal, the\\ninexperienced mind would naturally argue that a 50-horsepower engine\\nshould produce just double the speed of one of 25-horsepower.', 'That\\nthis is a fallacy is shown by actual performances.', 'The Wrights, using a\\n25-horsepower motor, have made 44 miles an hour, while Bleriot, with a\\n50-horsepower motor, has a record of a short-distance flight at the rate\\nof 52 miles an hour.', 'The fact is that, so far as speed is concerned,\\nmuch depends upon the velocity of the wind, the size and shape of the\\naeroplane itself, and the size, shape and gearing of the propeller.', 'The\\nstronger the wind is blowing the easier it will be for the aeroplane\\nto ascend, but at the same time the more difficult it will be to make\\nheadway against the wind in a horizontal direction.', 'With a strong head\\nwind, and proper engine force, your machine will progress to a certain\\nextent, but it will be at an angle.', 'If the aviator desired to keep\\non going upward this would be all right, but there is a limit to the\\naltitude which it is desirable to reach--from 100 to 500 feet for\\nexperts--and after that it becomes a question of going straight ahead.', 'Great Waste of Power.', 'One thing is certain--even in the most efficient of modern aerial motors\\nthere is a great loss of power between the two points of production and\\neffect.', 'The Wright outfit, which is admittedly one of the most effective\\nin use, takes one horsepower of force for the raising and propulsion of\\neach 50 pounds of weight.', 'This, for a 25-horsepower engine, would give\\na maximum lifting capacity of 1250 pounds.', 'It is doubtful if any of\\nthe higher rated motors have greater efficiency.', 'As an 8-cylinder motor\\nrequires more fuel to operate than a 4-cylinder, it naturally follows\\nthat it is more expensive to run than the smaller motor, and a normal\\nincrease in capacity, taking actual performances as a criterion, is\\nlacking.', 'In other words, what is the sense of using an 8-cylinder motor\\nwhen one of 4 cylinders is sufficient?', 'What the Propeller Does.', 'Much of the efficiency of the motor is due to the form and gearing of\\nthe propeller.', 'Here again, as in other vital parts of flying-machine\\nmechanism, we have a wide divergence of opinion as to the best form.', 'A\\nfish makes progress through the water by using its fins and tail; a\\nbird makes its way through the air in a similar manner by the use of its\\nwings and tail.', 'In both instances the motive power comes from the body\\nof the fish or bird.', 'In place of fins or wings the flying machine is equipped with a\\npropeller, the action of which is furnished by the engine.', \"Fins and\\nwings have been tried, but they don't work.\", 'While operating on the same general principle, aerial propellers are\\nmuch larger than those used on boats.', 'This is because the boat\\npropeller has a denser, more substantial medium to work in (water), and\\nconsequently can get a better \"hold,\" and produce more propulsive force\\nthan one of the same size revolving in the air.', 'This necessitates the\\naerial propellers being much larger than those employed for marine\\npurposes.', 'Up to this point all aviators agree, but as to the best form\\nmost of them differ.', 'Kinds of Propellers Used.', 'One of the most simple is that used by Curtiss.', 'It consists of two\\npear-shaped blades of laminated wood, each blade being 5 inches wide\\nat its extreme point, tapering slightly to the shaft connection.', 'These\\nblades are joined at the engine shaft, in a direct line.', 'The propeller\\nhas a pitch of 5 feet, and weighs, complete, less than 10 pounds.', 'The\\nlength from end to end of the two blades is 6 1/2 feet.', 'Wright uses two wooden propellers, in the rear of his biplane, revolving\\nin opposite directions.', 'Each propeller is two-bladed.', 'Bleriot also uses a two-blade wooden propeller, but it is placed in\\nfront of his machine.', 'The blades are each about 3 1/2 feet long and have\\nan acute \"twist.\"', 'Santos-Dumont uses a two-blade wooden propeller, strikingly similar to\\nthe Bleriot.', 'On the Antoinette monoplane, with which good records have been made, the\\npropeller consists of two spoon-shaped pieces of metal, joined at the\\nengine shaft in front, and with the concave surfaces facing the machine.', 'The propeller on the Voisin biplane is also of metal, consisting of two\\naluminum blades connected by a forged steel arm.', 'Maximum thrust, or stress--exercise of the greatest air-displacing\\nforce--is the object sought.', 'This, according to experts, is best\\nobtained with a large propeller diameter and reasonably low speed.', 'The\\ndiameter is the distance from end to end of the blades, which on the\\nlargest propellers ranges from 6 to 8 feet.', 'The larger the blade surface\\nthe greater will be the volume of air displaced, and, following this,\\nthe greater will be the impulse which forces the aeroplane ahead.', 'In all\\ncentrifugal motion there is more or less tendency to disintegration in\\nthe form of \"flying off\" from the center, and the larger the revolving\\nobject is the stronger is this tendency.', 'This is illustrated in the many\\ninstances in which big grindstones and fly-wheels have burst from being\\nrevolved too fast.', 'To have a propeller break apart in the air would\\njeopardize the life of the aviator, and to guard against this it has\\nbeen found best to make its revolving action comparatively slow.', 'Besides this the slow motion (it is only comparatively slow) gives the\\natmosphere a chance to refill the area disturbed by one propeller blade,\\nand thus have a new surface for the next blade to act upon.', 'Placing of the Motor.', 'As on other points, aviators differ widely in their ideas as to the\\nproper position for the motor.', 'Wright locates his on the lower plane,\\nmidway between the front and rear edges, but considerably to one side of\\nthe exact center.', 'He then counter-balances the engine weight by placing\\nhis seat far enough away in the opposite direction to preserve the\\ncenter of gravity.', 'This leaves a space in the center between the motor\\nand the operator in which a passenger may be carried without disturbing\\nthe equilibrium.', 'Bleriot, on the contrary, has his motor directly in front and preserves\\nthe center of gravity by taking his seat well back, this, with the\\nweight of the aeroplane, acting as a counter-balance.', 'On the Curtiss machine the motor is in the rear, the forward seat of the\\noperator, and weight of the horizontal rudder and damping plane in front\\nequalizing the engine weight.', 'No Perfect Motor as Yet.', 'Engine makers in the United States, England, France and Germany are all\\nseeking to produce an ideal motor for aviation purposes.', 'Many of the\\nproductions are highly creditable, but it may be truthfully said that\\nnone of them quite fill the bill as regards a combination of the minimum\\nof weight with the maximum of reliable maintained power.', 'They are all,\\nin some respects, improvements upon those previously in use, but the\\ngreat end sought for has not been fully attained.', 'One of the motors thus produced was made by the French firm of Darracq\\nat the suggestion of Santos Dumont, and on lines laid down by him.', 'Santos Dumont wanted a 2-cylinder horizontal motor capable of developing\\n30 horsepower, and not exceeding 4 1/2 pounds per horsepower in weight.', 'There can be no question as to the ability and skill of the Darracq\\npeople, or of their desire to produce a motor that would bring new\\ncredit and prominence to the firm.', 'Neither could anything radically\\nwrong be detected in the plans.', 'But the motor, in at least one important\\nrequirement, fell short of expectations.', 'It could not be depended upon to deliver an energy of 30 horsepower\\ncontinuously for any length of time.', 'Its maximum power could be secured\\nonly in \"spurts.\"', 'This tends to show how hard it is to produce an ideal motor for aviation\\npurposes.', 'Santos Dumont, of undoubted skill and experience as an\\naviator, outlined definitely what he wanted; one of the greatest\\ndesigners in the business drew the plans, and the famous house of\\nDarracq bent its best energies to the production.', 'But the desired end\\nwas not fully attained.', 'Features of Darracq Motor.', 'Horizontal motors were practically abandoned some time ago in favor of\\nthe vertical type, but Santos Dumont had a logical reason for reverting\\nto them.', 'He wanted to secure a lower center of gravity than would be\\npossible with a vertical engine.', 'Theoretically his idea was correct as\\nthe horizontal motor lies flat, and therefore offers less resistance to\\nthe wind, but it did not work out as desired.', 'At the same time it must be admitted that this Darracq motor is a marvel\\nof ingenuity and exquisite workmanship.', 'The two cylinders, having a bore\\nof 5 1-10 inches and a stroke of 4 7-10 inches, are machined out of a\\nsolid bar of steel until their weight is only 8 4-5 pounds complete.', 'The head is separate, carrying the seatings for the inlet and exhaust\\nvalves, is screwed onto the cylinder, and then welded in position.', 'A\\ncopper water-jacket is fitted, and it is in this condition that the\\nweight of 8 4-5 pounds is obtained.', 'On long trips, especially in regions where gasolene is hard to get,\\nthe weight of the fuel supply is an important feature in aviation.', 'As a\\nnatural consequence flying machine operators favor the motor of greatest\\neconomy in gasolene consumption, provided it gives the necessary power.', 'An American inventor, Ramsey by name, is working on a motor which\\nis said to possess great possibilities in this line.', 'Its distinctive\\nfeatures include a connecting rod much shorter than usual, and a crank\\nshaft located the length of the crank from the central axis of the\\ncylinder.', 'This has the effect of increasing the piston stroke, and also\\nof increasing the proportion of the crank circle during which effective\\npressure is applied to the crank.', 'Making the connecting rod shorter and leaving the crank mechanism the\\nsame would introduce excessive cylinder friction.', 'This Ramsey overcomes\\nby the location of his crank shaft.', 'The effect of the long piston stroke\\nthus secured, is to increase the expansion of the gases, which in turn\\nincreases the power of the engine without increasing the amount of fuel\\nused.', 'Propeller Thrust Important.', 'There is one great principle in flying machine propulsion which must\\nnot be overlooked.', 'No matter how powerful the engine may be unless the\\npropeller thrust more than overcomes the wind pressure there can be no\\nprogress forward.', 'Should the force of this propeller thrust and that of\\nthe wind pressure be equal the result is obvious.', 'The machine is at a\\nstand-still so far as forward progress is concerned and is deprived of\\nthe essential advancing movement.', 'Speed not only furnishes sustentation for the airship, but adds to the\\nstability of the machine.', 'An aeroplane which may be jerky and uncertain\\nin its movements, so far as equilibrium is concerned, when moving at\\na slow gait, will readily maintain an even keel when the speed is\\nincreased.', 'Designs for Propeller Blades.', 'It is the object of all men who design propellers to obtain the maximum\\nof thrust with the minimum expenditure of engine energy.', 'With this\\npurpose in view many peculiar forms of propeller blades have been\\nevolved.', 'In theory it would seem that the best effects could be secured\\nwith blades so shaped as to present a thin (or cutting) edge when they\\ncome out of the wind, and then at the climax of displacement afford a\\nmaximum of surface so as to displace as much air as possible.', 'While\\nthis is the form most generally favored there are others in successful\\noperation.', 'There is also wide difference in opinion as to the equipment of the\\npropeller shaft with two or more blades.', 'Some aviators use two and some\\nfour.', 'All have more or less success.', 'As a mathematical proposition it\\nwould seem that four blades should give more propulsive force than two,\\nbut here again comes in one of the puzzles of aviation, as this result\\nis not always obtained.', 'Difference in Propeller Efficiency.', 'That there is a great difference in propeller efficiency is made readily\\napparent by the comparison of effects produced in two leading makes of\\nmachines--the Wright and the Voisin.', 'In the former a weight of from 1,100 to 1,200 pounds is sustained and\\nadvance progress made at the rate of 40 miles an hour and more, with\\nhalf the engine speed of a 25 horse-power motor.', 'This would be a\\nsustaining capacity of 48 pounds per horsepower.', 'But the actual capacity\\nof the Wright machine, as already stated, is 50 pounds per horsepower.', 'The Voisin machine, with aviator, weighs about 1,370 pounds, and is\\noperated with a so-horsepower motor.', 'Allowing it the same speed as the\\nWright we find that, with double the engine energy, the lifting capacity\\nis only 27 1/2 pounds per horsepower.', 'To what shall we charge this\\nremarkable difference?', 'The surface of the planes is exactly the same in\\nboth machines so there is no advantage in the matter of supporting area.', 'Comparison of Two Designs.', 'On the Wright machine two wooden propellers of two blades each (each\\nblade having a decided \"twist\") are used.', 'As one 25 horsepower motor\\ndrives both propellers the engine energy amounts to just one-half of\\nthis for each, or 12 1/2 horsepower.', 'And this energy is utilized at\\none-half the normal engine speed.', 'On the Voisin a radically different system is employed.', 'Here we have\\none metal two-bladed propeller with a very slight \"twist\" to the blade\\nsurfaces.', 'The full energy of a 50-horsepower motor is utilized.', 'Experts Fail to Agree.', 'Why should there be such a marked difference in the results obtained?', 'Who knows?', 'Some experts maintain that it is because there are two\\npropellers on the Wright machine and only one on the Voisin, and\\nconsequently double the propulsive power is exerted.', 'But this is not a\\nfair deduction, unless both propellers are of the same size.', 'Propulsive\\npower depends upon the amount of air displaced, and the energy put into\\nthe thrust which displaces the air.', 'Other experts argue that the difference in results may be traced to the\\ndifference in blade design, especially in the matter of \"twist.\"', 'The fact is that propeller results depend largely upon the nature of\\nthe aeroplanes on which they are used.', 'A propeller, for instance,\\nwhich gives excellent results on one type of aeroplane, will not work\\nsatisfactorily on another.', 'There are some features, however, which may be safely adopted in\\npropeller selection.', 'These are: As extensive a diameter as possible;\\nblade area 10 to 15 per cent of the area swept; pitch four-fifths of\\nthe diameter; rotation slow.', 'The maximum of thrust effort will be thus\\nobtained.', 'CHAPTER X.', 'PROPER DIMENSIONS OF MACHINES.', 'In laying out plans for a flying machine the first thing to decide upon\\nis the size of the plane surfaces.', 'The proportions of these must be\\nbased upon the load to be carried.', 'This includes the total weight of\\nthe machine and equipment, and also the operator.', 'This will be a rather\\ndifficult problem to figure out exactly, but practical approximate\\nfigures may be reached.', 'It is easy to get at the weight of the operator, motor and propeller,\\nbut the matter of determining, before they are constructed, what the\\nplanes, rudders, auxiliaries, etc., will weigh when completed is an\\nintricate proposition.', 'The best way is to

E. P.--Five pounds.', 'Antoinette--About two and one-quarter pounds.', 'Curtiss--About two and one-half pounds.', 'Wright--Two and one-quarter pounds.', 'Farman--A trifle over three pounds.', 'Voisin--A little under two and one-half pounds.', 'Importance of Engine Power.', 'While these figures are authentic, they are in a way misleading, as the\\nimportant factor of engine power is not taken into consideration.', 'Let us\\nrecall the fact that it is the engine power which keeps the machine in\\nmotion, and that it is only while in motion that the machine will remain\\nsuspended in the air.', 'Hence, to attribute the support solely to the\\nsurface area is erroneous.', 'True, that once under headway the planes\\ncontribute largely to the sustaining effect, and are absolutely\\nessential in aerial navigation--the motor could not rise without\\nthem--still, when it comes to a question of weight-sustaining power, we\\nmust also figure on the engine capacity.', 'In the Wright machine, in which there is a lifting capacity of\\napproximately 2 1/4 pounds to the square foot of surface area, an engine\\nof only 25 horsepower is used.', 'In the Curtiss, which has a lifting\\ncapacity of 2 1/2 pounds per square foot, the engine is of 50\\nhorsepower.', 'This is another of the peculiarities of aerial construction\\nand navigation.', 'Here we have a gain of 1/4 pound in weight-lifting\\ncapacity with an expenditure of double the horsepower.', 'It is this\\nfeature which enables Curtiss to get along with a smaller surface area\\nof supporting planes at the expense of a big increase in engine power.', 'Proper Weight of Machine.', 'As a general proposition the most satisfactory machine for amateur\\npurposes will be found to be one with a total weight-sustaining power of\\nabout 1,200 pounds.', 'Deducting 170 pounds as the weight of the operator,\\nthis will leave 1,030 pounds for the complete motor-equipped machine,\\nand it should be easy to construct one within this limit.', 'This implies,\\nof course, that due care will be taken to eliminate all superfluous\\nweight by using the lightest material compatible with strength and\\nsafety.', 'This plan will admit of 686 pounds weight in the frame work, coverings,\\netc., and 344 for the motor, propeller, etc., which will be ample.', 'Just\\nhow to distribute the weight of the planes is a matter which must be\\nleft to the ingenuity of the builder.', 'Comparison of Bird Power.', 'There is an interesting study in the accompanying illustration.', 'Note\\nthat the surface area of the albatross is much smaller than that of the\\nvulture, although the wing spread is about the same.', 'Despite this the\\nalbatross accomplishes fully as much in the way of flight and soaring as\\nthe vulture.', 'Why?', 'Because the albaboss is quicker and more powerful in\\naction.', 'It is the application of this same principle in flying machines\\nwhich enables those of great speed and power to get along with less\\nsupporting surface than those of slower movement.', 'Measurements of Curtiss Machine.', 'Some idea of framework proportion may be had from the following\\ndescription of the Curtiss machine.', 'The main planes have a spread\\n(width) of 29 feet, and are 4 1/2 feet deep.', 'The front double surface\\nhorizontal rudder is 6x2 feet, with an area of 24 square feet.', 'To the\\nrear of the main planes is a single surface horizontal plane 6x2 feet,\\nwith an area of 12 square feet.', 'In connection with this is a vertical\\nrudder 2 1/2 feet square.', 'Two movable ailerons, or balancing planes, are\\nplaced at the extreme ends of the upper planes.', 'These are 6x2 feet,\\nand have a combined area of 24 square feet.', 'There is also a triangular\\nshaped vertical steadying surface in connection with the front rudder.', 'Thus we have a total of 195 square feet, but as the official figures are\\n258, and the size of the triangular-shaped steadying surface is unknown,\\nwe must take it for granted that this makes up the difference.', 'In\\nthe matter of proportion the horizontal double-plane rudder is about\\none-tenth the size of the main plane, counting the surface area of\\nonly one plane, the vertical rudder one-fortieth, and the ailerons\\none-twentieth.', 'CHAPTER XI.', 'PLANE AND RUDDER CONTROL.', 'Having constructed and equipped your machine, the next thing is to\\ndecide upon the method of controlling the various rudders and auxiliary\\nplanes by which the direction and equilibrium and ascending and\\ndescending of the machine are governed.', 'The operator must be in position to shift instantaneously the position\\nof rudders and planes, and also to control the action of the motor.', 'This\\nlatter is supposed to work automatically and as a general thing does\\nso with entire satisfaction, but there are times when the supply of\\ngasolene must be regulated, and similar things done.', 'Airship navigation\\ncalls for quick action, and for this reason the matter of control is an\\nimportant one--it is more than important; it is vital.', 'Several Methods of Control.', 'Some aviators use a steering wheel somewhat after the style of that used\\nin automobiles, and by this not only manipulate the rudder planes, but\\nalso the flow of gasolene.', 'Others employ foot levers, and still others,\\nlike the Wrights, depend upon hand levers.', 'Curtiss steers his aeroplane by means of a wheel, but secures the\\ndesired stabilizing effect with an ingenious jointed chair-back.', 'This is\\nso arranged that by leaning toward the high point of his wing planes the\\naeroplane is restored to an even keel.', 'The steering post of the wheel is\\nmovable backward and forward, and by this motion elevation is obtained.', 'The Wrights for some time used two hand levers, one to steer by and warp\\nthe flexible tips of the planes, the other to secure elevation.', 'They\\nhave now consolidated all the functions in one lever.', 'Bleriot also uses\\nthe single lever control.', 'Farman employs a lever to actuate the rudders, but manipulates the\\nbalancing planes by foot levers.', 'Santos-Dumont uses two hand levers with which to steer and elevate,\\nbut manipulates the planes by means of an attachment to the back of his\\nouter coat.', 'Connection With the Levers.', 'No matter which particular method is employed, the connection between\\nthe levers and the object to be manipulated is almost invariably by\\nwire.', 'For instance, from the steering levers (or lever) two wires\\nconnect with opposite sides of the rudder.', 'As a lever is moved so as to\\ndraw in the right-hand wire the rudder is drawn to the right and vice\\nversa.', 'The operation is exactly the same as in steering a boat.', 'It\\nis the same way in changing the position of the balancing planes.', 'A\\nmovement of the hands or feet and the machine has changed its course,\\nor, if the equilibrium is threatened, is back on an even keel.', 'Simple as this seems it calls for a cool head, quick eye, and steady\\nhand.', 'The least hesitation or a false movement, and both aviator and\\ncraft are in danger.', 'Which Method is Best?', 'It would be a bold man who would attempt to pick out any one of these\\nmethods of control and say it was better than the others.', 'As in other\\nsections of aeroplane mechanism each method has its advocates who dwell\\nlearnedly upon its advantages, but the fact remains that all the various\\nplans work well and give satisfaction.', 'What the novice is interested in knowing is how the control is effected,\\nand whether he has become proficient enough in his manipulation of it to\\nbe absolutely dependable in time of emergency.', 'No amateur should attempt\\na flight alone, until he has thoroughly mastered the steering and plane\\ncontrol.', \"If the services and advice of an experienced aviator are not to\\nbe had the novice should mount his machine on some suitable supports so\\nit will be well clear of the ground, and, getting into the operator's\\nseat, proceed to make himself well acquainted with the operation of the\\nsteering wheel and levers.\", 'Some Things to Be Learned.', 'He will soon learn that certain movements of the steering gear produce\\ncertain effects on the rudders.', 'If, for instance, his machine is\\nequipped with a steering wheel, he will find that turning the wheel to\\nthe right turns the aeroplane in the same direction, because the tiller\\nis brought around to the left.', 'In the same way he will learn that a\\ngiven movement of the lever throws the forward edge of the main plane\\nupward, and that the machine, getting the impetus of the wind under the\\nconcave surfaces of the planes, will ascend.', 'In the same way it will\\nquickly become apparent to him that an opposite movement of the lever\\nwill produce an opposite effect--the forward edges of the planes will be\\nlowered, the air will be \"spilled\" out to the rear, and the machine will\\ndescend.', 'The time expended in these preliminary lessons will be well spent.', 'It\\nwould be an act of folly to attempt to actually sail the craft without\\nthem.', 'CHAPTER XII.', 'HOW TO USE THE MACHINE.', 'It is a mistaken idea that flying machines must be operated at extreme\\naltitudes.', 'True, under the impetus of handsome prizes, and the incentive\\nto advance scientific knowledge, professional aviators have ascended to\\nconsiderable heights, flights at from 500 to 1,500 feet being now\\ncommon with such experts as Farman, Bleriot, Latham, Paulhan, Wright and\\nCurtiss.', 'The altitude record at this time is about 4,165 feet, held by\\nPaulhan.', 'One of the instructions given by experienced aviators to pupils, and for\\nwhich they insist upon implicit obeyance, is: \"If your machine gets more\\nthan 30 feet high, or comes closer to the ground than 6 feet, descend at\\nonce.\"', 'Such men as Wright and Curtiss will not tolerate a violation of\\nthis rule.', 'If their instructions are not strictly complied with they\\ndecline to give the offender further lessons.', 'Why This Rule Prevails.', 'There is good reason for this precaution.', 'The higher the altitude the\\nmore rarefied (thinner) becomes the air, and the less sustaining power\\nit has.', 'Consequently the more difficult it becomes to keep in suspension\\na given weight.', 'When sailing within 30 feet of the ground sustentation\\nis comparatively easy and, should a fall occur, the results are not\\nlikely to be serious.', 'On the other hand, sailing too near the ground\\nis almost as objectionable in many ways as getting up too high.', 'If the\\ncraft is navigated too close to the ground trees, shrubs, fences and\\nother obstructions are liable to be encountered.', 'There is also the\\nhandicap of contrary air currents diverted by the obstructions referred\\nto, and which will be explained more fully further on.', 'How to Make a Start.', 'Taking it for granted that the beginner has familiarized himself with\\nthe manipulation of the machine, and especially the control mechanism,\\nthe next thing in order is an actual flight.', 'It is probable that his\\nmachine will be equipped with a wheeled alighting gear, as the skids\\nused by the Wrights necessitate the use of a special starting track.', 'In this respect the wheeled machine is much easier to handle so far as\\nnovices are concerned as it may be easily rolled to the trial grounds.', 'This, as in the case of the initial experiments, should be a clear,\\nreasonably level place, free from trees, fences, rocks and similar\\nobstructions with which there may be danger of colliding.', 'The beginner will need the assistance of three men.', 'One of these should\\ntake his position in the rear of the machine, and one at each end.', 'On\\nreaching the trial ground the aviator takes his seat in the machine and,\\nwhile the men at the ends hold it steady the one in the rear assists in\\nretaining it until the operator is ready.', 'In the meantime the aviator\\nhas started his motor.', 'Like the glider the flying machine, in order to\\naccomplish the desired results, should be headed into the wind.', 'When the Machine Rises.', 'Under the impulse of the pushing movement, and assisted by the motor\\naction, the machine will gradually rise from the ground--provided it\\nhas been properly proportioned and put together, and everything is in\\nworking order.', 'This is the time when the aviator requires a cool head,\\nAt a modest distance from the ground use the control lever to bring the\\nmachine on a horizontal level and overcome the tendency to rise.', 'The\\nexact manipulation of this lever depends upon the method of control\\nadopted, and with this the aviator is supposed to have thoroughly\\nfamiliarized himself as previously advised in Chapter XI.', 'It is at this juncture that the operator must act promptly, but with the\\nperfect composure begotten of confidence.', 'One of the great drawbacks in\\naviation by novices is the tendency to become rattled, and this is much\\nmore prevalent than one might suppose, even among men who, under other\\nconditions, are cool and confident in their actions.', 'There is something in the sensation of being suddenly lifted from the\\nground, and suspended in the air that is disconcerting at the start,\\nbut this will soon wear off if the experimenter will keep cool.', 'A few\\nsuccessful flights no matter how short they may be, will put a lot of\\nconfidence into him.', 'Make Your Flights Short.', 'Be modest in your initial flights.', \"Don't attempt to match the records\\nof experienced men who have devoted years to mastering the details of\\naviation.\", 'Paulhan, Farman, Bleriot, Wright, Curtiss, and all the rest of\\nthem began, and practiced for years, in the manner here described, being\\ncontent to make just a little advancement at each attempt.', 'A flight of\\n150 feet, cleanly and safely made, is better as a beginning than one of\\n400 yards full of bungling mishaps.', 'And yet these latter have their uses, provided the operator is of a\\ndiscerning mind and can take advantage of them as object lessons.', 'But,\\nit is not well to invite them.', 'They will occur frequently enough under\\nthe most favorable conditions, and it is best to have them come later\\nwhen the feeling of trepidation and uncertainty as to what to do has\\nworn off.', \"Above all, don't attempt to fly too high.\", 'Keep within a reasonable\\ndistance from the ground--about 25 or 30 feet.', 'This advice is not given\\nsolely to lessen the risk of serious accident in case of collapse, but\\nmainly because it will assist to instill confidence in the operator.', 'It is comparatively easy to learn to swim in shallow water, but the\\nknowledge that one is tempting death in deep water begets timidity.', 'Preserving the Equilibrium.', 'After learning how to start and stop, to ascend and descend, the next\\nthing to master is the art of preserving equilibrium, the knack of\\nkeeping the machine perfectly level in the air--on an \"even keel,\" as\\na sailor would say.', 'This simile is particularly appropriate as all\\naviators are in reality sailors, and much more daring ones than those\\nwho course the seas.', 'The latter are in craft which are kept afloat by\\nthe buoyancy of the water, whether in motion or otherwise and, so long\\nas normal conditions prevail, will not sink.', 'Aviators sail the air in\\ncraft in which constant motion must be maintained in order to ensure\\nflotation.', 'The man who has ridden a bicycle or motorcycle around curves at anything\\nlike high speed, will have a very good idea as to the principle of\\nmaintaining equilibrium in an airship.', 'He knows that in rounding curves\\nrapidly there is a marked tendency to change the direction of the motion\\nwhich will result in an upset unless he overcomes it by an inclination\\nof his body in an opposite direction.', 'This is why we see racers lean\\nwell over when taking the curves.', 'It simply must be done to preserve the\\nequilibrium and avoid a spill.', 'How It Works In the Air.', 'If the equilibrium of an airship is disturbed to an extent which\\ncompletely overcomes the center of gravity it falls according to the\\nlocation of the displacement.', 'If this displacement, for instance, is at\\neither end the apparatus falls endways; if it is to the front or rear,\\nthe fall is in the corresponding direction.', 'Owing to uncertain air currents--the air is continually shifting and\\neddying, especially within a hundred feet or so of the earth--the\\nequilibrium of an airship is almost constantly being disturbed to some\\nextent.', 'Even if this disturbance is not serious enough to bring on\\na fall it interferes with the progress of the machine, and should\\nbe overcome at once.', 'This is one of the things connected with aerial\\nnavigation which calls for prompt, intelligent action.', \"Frequently, when the displacement is very slight, it may be overcome,\\nand the craft immediately righted by a mere shifting of the operator's\\nbody.\", 'Take, for illustration, a case in which the extreme right end\\nof the machine becomes lowered a trifle from the normal level.', 'It is\\npossible to bring it back into proper position by leaning over to the\\nleft far enough to shift the weight to the counter-balancing point.', 'The\\nsame holds good as to minor front or rear displacements.', 'When Planes Must Be Used.', 'There are other displacements, however, and these are the most frequent,\\nwhich can be only overcome by manipulation of the stabilizing planes.', 'The method of procedure depends upon the form of machine in use.', 'The\\nWright machine, as previously explained, is equipped with plane ends\\nwhich are so contrived as to admit of their being warped (position\\nchanged) by means of the lever control.', 'These flexible tip planes move\\nsimultaneously, but in opposite directions.', 'As those on one end rise,\\nthose on the other end fall below the level of the main plane.', 'By this\\nmeans air is displaced at one point, and an increased amount secured in\\nanother.', 'This may seem like a complicated system, but its workings are simple\\nwhen once understood.', 'It is by the manipulation or warping of these\\nflexible tips that transverse stability is maintained, and any tendency\\nto displacement endways is overcome.', 'Longitudinal stability is governed\\nby means of the front rudder.', 'Stabilizing planes of some form are a feature, and a necessary feature,\\non all flying machines, but the methods of application and manipulation\\nvary according to the individual ideas of the inventors.', 'They all tend,\\nhowever, toward the same end--the keeping of the machine perfectly level\\nwhen being navigated in the air.', 'When to Make a Flight.', 'A beginner should never attempt to make a flight when a strong wind is\\nblowing.', 'The fiercer the wind, the more likely it is to be gusty and\\nuncertain, and the more difficult it will be to control the machine.', 'Even the most experienced and daring of aviators find there is a limit\\nto wind speed against which they dare not compete.', 'This is not because\\nthey lack courage, but have the sense to realize that it would be silly\\nand useless.', 'The novice will find a comparatively still day, or one when the wind is\\nblowing at not to exceed 15 miles an hour, the best for his experiments.', 'The machine will be more easily controlled, the trip will be safer, and\\nalso cheaper as the consumption of fuel increases with the speed of the\\nwind against which the aeroplane is forced.', 'CHAPTER XIII.', 'PECULIARITIES OF AIRSHIP POWER.', 'As a general proposition it takes much more power to propel an airship\\na given number of miles in a certain time than it does an automobile\\ncarrying a far heavier load.', 'Automobiles with a gross load of 4,000\\npounds, and equipped with engines of 30 horsepower, have travelled\\nconsiderable distances at the rate of 50 miles an hour.', 'This is an\\nequivalent of about 134 pounds per horsepower.', 'For an average modern\\nflying machine, with a total load, machine and passengers, of 1,200\\npounds, and equipped with a 50-horsepower engine, 50 miles an hour\\nis the maximum.', 'Here we have the equivalent of exactly 24 pounds per\\nhorsepower.', 'Why this great difference?', 'No less an authority than Mr.', 'Octave Chanute answers the question in a\\nplain, easily understood manner.', 'He says:\\n\\n\"In the case of an automobile the ground furnishes a stable support;\\nin the case of a flying machine the engine must furnish the support and\\nalso velocity by which the apparatus is sustained in the air.\"', 'Pressure of the Wind.', 'Air pressure is a big factor in the matter of aeroplane horsepower.', 'Allowing that a dead calm exists, a body moving in the atmosphere\\ncreates more or less resistance.', 'The faster it moves, the greater is\\nthis resistance.', 'Moving at the rate of 60 miles an hour the resistance,\\nor wind pressure, is approximately 50 pounds to the square foot of\\nsurface presented.', 'If the moving object is advancing at a right angle\\nto the wind the following table will give the horsepower effect of the\\nresistance per square foot of surface at various speeds.', 'Horse Power\\n          Miles per Hour    per sq.', 'foot\\n          10             0.013\\n          15             0 044\\n          20             0.105\\n          25             0.205\\n          30             0.354\\n          40             0.84\\n          50

miles, less than double the speed, it has increased\\nto 13.12 horsepower, or exactly eight times as much.', 'In other words the\\npressure of the wind increases with the square of the velocity.', 'Wind at\\n10 miles an hour has four times more pressure than wind at 5 miles an\\nhour.', 'How to Determine Upon Power.', 'This element of air resistance must be taken into consideration in\\ndetermining the engine horsepower required.', 'When the machine is under\\nheadway sufficient to raise it from the ground (about 20 miles an hour),\\neach square foot of surface resistance, will require nearly nine-tenths\\nof a horsepower to overcome the wind pressure, and propel the machine\\nthrough the air.', 'As shown in the table the ratio of power required\\nincreases rapidly as the speed increases until at 60 miles an hour\\napproximately 3 horsepower is needed.', 'In a machine like the Curtiss the area of wind-exposed surface is about\\n15 square feet.', 'On the basis of this resistance moving the machine at 40\\nmiles an hour would require 12 horsepower.', \"This computation covers only\\nthe machine's power to overcome resistance.\", 'It does not cover the power\\nexerted in propelling the machine forward after the air pressure is\\novercome.', 'To meet this important requirement Mr. Curtiss finds it\\nnecessary to use a 50-horsepower engine.', 'Of this power, as has been\\nalready stated, 12 horsepower is consumed in meeting the wind pressure,\\nleaving 38 horsepower for the purpose of making progress.', 'The flying machine must move faster than the air to which it is opposed.', 'Unless it does this there can be no direct progress.', 'If the two forces\\nare equal there is no straight-ahead advancement.', 'Take, for sake of\\nillustration, a case in which an aeroplane, which has developed a speed\\nof 30 miles an hour, meets a wind velocity of equal force moving in an\\nopposite direction.', 'What is the result?', 'There can be no advance because\\nit is a contest between two evenly matched forces.', 'The aeroplane stands\\nstill.', 'The only way to get out of the difficulty is for the operator to\\nwait for more favorable conditions, or bring his machine to the ground\\nin the usual manner by manipulation of the control system.', 'Take another case.', 'An aeroplane, capable of making 50 miles an hour in a\\ncalm, is met by a head wind of 25 miles an hour.', 'How much progress does\\nthe aeroplane make?', 'Obviously it is 25 miles an hour over the ground.', 'Put the proposition in still another way.', 'If the wind is blowing harder\\nthan it is possible for the engine power to overcome, the machine will\\nbe forced backward.', 'Wind Pressure a Necessity.', 'While all this is true, the fact remains that wind pressure, up to\\na certain stage, is an absolute necessity in aerial navigation.', 'The\\natmosphere itself has very little real supporting power, especially if\\ninactive.', 'If a body heavier than air is to remain afloat it must move\\nrapidly while in suspension.', 'One of the best illustrations of this is to be found in skating over\\nthin ice.', 'Every school boy knows that if he moves with speed he may\\nskate or glide in safety across a thin sheet of ice that would not\\nbegin to bear his weight if he were standing still.', 'Exactly the same\\nproposition obtains in the case of the flying machine.', 'The non-technical reason why the support of the machine becomes easier\\nas the speed increases is that the sustaining power of the atmosphere\\nincreases with the resistance, and the speed with which the object is\\nmoving increases this resistance.', 'With a velocity of 12 miles an hour\\nthe weight of the machine is practically reduced by 230 pounds.', 'Thus, if\\nunder a condition of absolute calm it were possible to sustain a weight\\nof 770 pounds, the same atmosphere would sustain a weight of 1,000\\npounds moving at a speed of 12 miles an hour.', 'This sustaining power\\nincreases rapidly as the speed increases.', 'While at 12 miles the\\nsustaining power is figured at 230 pounds, at 24 miles it is four times\\nas great, or 920 pounds.', 'Supporting Area of Birds.', 'One of the things which all producing aviators seek to copy is the\\nmotive power of birds, particularly in their relation to the area of\\nsupport.', 'Close investigation has established the fact that the larger\\nthe bird the less is the relative area of support required to secure a\\ngiven result.', 'This is shown in the following table:\\n\\n

a little over 1-100 horsepower, it may be seen\\nthat, broadly speaking, the larger the bird the less surface area\\n(relatively) is needed for its support in the air.', 'Comparison With Aeroplanes.',

one-half square foot per pound.', 'On the other hand the average\\naeroplane has a lifting capacity of 24 pounds per horsepower, while the\\nbuzzard, for instance, lifts 5 pounds with 15-100 of a horsepower.', 'If the Wright machine--which has a lifting power of 50 pounds per\\nhorsepower--should be alone considered the showing would be much more\\nfavorable to the aeroplane, but it would not be a fair comparison.', 'More Surface, Less Power.', 'Broadly speaking, the larger the supporting area the less will be the\\npower required.', 'Wright, by the use of 538 square feet of supporting\\nsurface, gets along with an engine of 25 horsepower.', 'Curtiss, who uses\\nonly 258 square feet of surface, finds an engine of 50 horsepower is\\nneeded.', 'Other things, such as frame, etc., being equal, it stands\\nto reason that a reduction in the area of supporting surface will\\ncorrespondingly reduce the weight of the machine.', 'Thus we have the\\nCurtiss machine with its 258 square feet of surface, weighing only 600\\npounds (without operator), but requiring double the horsepower of\\nthe Wright machine with 538 square feet of surface and weighing 1,100\\npounds.', 'This demonstrates in a forceful way the proposition that the\\nlarger the surface the less power will be needed.', 'But there is a limit, on account of its bulk and awkwardness in\\nhandling, beyond which the surface area cannot be enlarged.', 'Otherwise\\nit might be possible to equip and operate aeroplanes satisfactorily with\\nengines of 15 horsepower, or even less.', 'The Fuel Consumption Problem.', 'Fuel consumption is a prime factor in the production of engine power.', 'The veriest mechanical tyro knows in a general way that the more power\\nis secured the more fuel must be consumed, allowing that there is no\\ndifference in the power-producing qualities of the material used.', 'But\\nfew of us understand just what the ratio of increase is, or how it is\\ncaused.', 'This proposition is one of keen interest in connection with\\naviation.', 'Let us cite a problem which will illustrate the point quoted: Allowing\\nthat it takes a given amount of gasolene to propel a flying machine a\\ngiven distance, half the way with the wind, and half against it, the\\nwind blowing at one-half the speed of the machine, what will be the\\nincrease in fuel consumption?', 'Increase of Thirty Per Cent.', 'On the face of it there would seem to be no call for an increase as the\\nresistance met when going against the wind is apparently offset by the\\npropulsive force of the wind when the machine is travelling with\\nit.', 'This, however, is called faulty reasoning.', 'The increase in fuel\\nconsumption, as figured by Mr. F. W. Lanchester, of the Royal Society of\\nArts, will be fully 30 per cent over the amount required for a similar\\noperation of the machine in still air.', 'If the journey should be made at\\nright angles to the wind under the same conditions the increase would be\\n15 per cent.', 'In other words Mr. Lanchester maintains that the work done by the motor\\nin making headway against the wind for a certain distance calls for more\\nengine energy, and consequently more fuel by 30 per cent, than is saved\\nby the helping force of the wind on the return journey.', 'CHAPTER XIV.', 'ABOUT WIND CURRENTS, ETC.', 'One of the first difficulties which the novice will encounter is the\\nuncertainty of the wind currents.', 'With a low velocity the wind, some\\ndistance away from the ground, is ordinarily steady.', 'As the velocity\\nincreases, however, the wind generally becomes gusty and fitful in its\\naction.', 'This, it should be remembered, does not refer to the velocity of\\nthe machine, but to that of the air itself.', 'In this connection Mr. Arthur T. Atherholt, president of the Aero\\nClub of Pennsylvania, in addressing the Boston Society of Scientific\\nResearch, said:\\n\\n\"Probably the whirlpools of Niagara contain no more erratic currents\\nthan the strata of air which is now immediately above us, a fact hard to\\nrealize on account of its invisibility.\"', 'Changes In Wind Currents.', \"While Mr. Atherholt's experience has been mainly with balloons it is all\\nthe more valuable on this account, as the balloons were at the mercy of\\nthe wind and their varying directions afforded an indisputable guide as\\nto the changing course of the air currents.\", 'In speaking of this he said:\\n\\n\"In the many trips taken, varying in distance traversed from twenty-five\\nto 900 miles, it was never possible except in one instance to maintain\\na straight course.', 'These uncertain currents were most noticeable in\\nthe Gordon-Bennett race from St. Louis in 1907.', 'Of the nine aerostats\\ncompeting in that event, eight covered a more or less direct course\\ndue east and southeast, whereas the writer, with Major Henry B. Hersey,\\nfirst started northwest, then north, northeast, east, east by south,\\nand when over the center of Lake Erie were again blown northwest\\nnotwithstanding that more favorable winds were sought for at altitudes\\nvarying from 100 to 3,000 meters, necessitating a finish in Canada\\nnearly northeast of the starting point.', '\"These nine balloons, making landings extending from Lake Ontario,\\nCanada, to Virginia, all started from one point within the same hour.', '\"The single exception to these roving currents occurred on October 21st,\\nof last year (1909) when, starting from Philadelphia, the wind shifted\\nmore than eight degrees, the greatest variation being at the lowest\\naltitudes, yet at no time was a height of over a mile reached.', '\"Throughout the entire day the sky was overcast, with a thermometer\\nvarying from fifty-seven degrees at 300 feet to forty-four degrees,\\nFahrenheit at 5,000 feet, at which altitude the wind had a velocity of\\n43 miles an hour, in clouds of a cirro-cumulus nature, a landing finally\\nbeing made near Tannersville, New York, in the Catskill mountains, after\\na voyage of five and one-half hours.', '\"I have no knowledge of a recorded trip of this distance and duration,\\nmaintained in practically a straight line from start to finish.\"', 'This wind disturbance is more noticeable and more difficult to contend\\nwith in a balloon than in a flying machine, owing to the bulk and\\nunwieldy character of the former.', 'At the same time it is not conducive\\nto pleasant, safe or satisfactory sky-sailing in an aeroplane.', 'This is\\nnot stated with the purpose of discouraging aviation, but merely that\\nthe operator may know what to expect and be prepared to meet it.', 'Not only does the wind change its horizontal course abruptly and without\\nnotice, but it also shifts in a vertical direction, one second blowing\\nup, and another down.', 'No man has as yet fathomed the why and wherefore\\nof this erratic action; it is only known that it exists.', 'The most stable currents will be found from 50 to 100 feet from the\\nearth, provided the wind is not diverted by such objects as trees,\\nrocks, etc.', 'That there are equally stable currents higher up is true,\\nbut they are generally to be found at excessive altitudes.', 'How a Bird Meets Currents.', 'Observe a bird in action on a windy day and you will find it continually\\nchanging the position of its wings.', 'This is done to meet the varying\\ngusts and eddies of the air so that sustentation may be maintained and\\nheadway made.', 'One second the bird is bending its wings, altering the\\nangle of incidence; the next it is lifting or depressing one wing at a\\ntime.', 'Still again it will extend one wing tip in advance of the other,\\nor be spreading or folding, lowering or raising its tail.', 'All these motions have a meaning, a purpose.', 'They assist the bird in\\npreserving its equilibrium.', 'Without them the bird would be just as\\nhelpless in the air as a human being and could not remain afloat.', 'When the wind is still, or comparatively so, a bird, having secured the\\ndesired altitude by flight at an angle, may sail or soar with no wing\\naction beyond an occasional stroke when it desires to advance.', 'But, in a\\ngusty, uncertain wind it must use its wings or alight somewhere.', 'Trying to Imitate the Bird.', 'Writing in _Fly_, Mr. William E. White says:\\n\\n\"The bird\\'s flight suggests a number of ways in which the equilibrium\\nof a mechanical bird may be controlled.', 'Each of these methods of control\\nmay be effected by several different forms of mechanism.', '\"Placing the two wings of an aeroplane at an angle of three to five\\ndegrees to each other is perhaps the oldest way of securing lateral\\nbalance.', 'This way readily occurs to anyone who watches a sea gull\\nsoaring.', 'The theory of the dihedral angle is that when one wing is\\nlifted by a gust of wind, the air is spilled from under it; while\\nthe other wing, being correspondingly depressed, presents a greater\\nresistance to the gust and is lifted restoring the balance.', 'A fixed\\nangle of three to five degrees, however, will only be sufficient for\\nvery light puffs of wind and to mount the wings so that the whole\\nwing may be moved to change the dihedral angle presents mechanical\\ndifficulties which would be better avoided.', '\"The objection of mechanical impracticability applies to any plan\\nto preserve the balance by shifting weight or ballast.', 'The center of\\ngravity should be lower than the center of the supporting surfaces,\\nbut cannot be made much lower.', 'It is a common mistake to assume that\\ncomplete stability will be secured by hanging the center of gravity very\\nlow on the principle of the parachute.', 'An aeroplane depends upon rapid\\nhorizontal motion for its support, and if the center of gravity be far\\nbelow the center of support, every change of speed or wind pressure will\\ncause the machine to turn about its center of gravity, pitching forward\\nand backward dangerously.', 'Preserving Longitudinal Balance.', '\"The birds maintain longitudinal, or fore and aft balance, by elevating\\nor depressing their tails.', 'Whether this action is secured in an\\naeroplane by means of a horizontal rudder placed in the rear, or by\\ndeflecting planes placed in front of the main planes, the principle is\\nevidently the same.', 'A horizontal rudder placed well to the rear as in\\nthe Antoinette, Bleriot or Santos-Dumont monoplanes, will be very much\\nsafer and steadier than the deflecting planes in front, as in the Wright\\nor Curtiss biplanes, but not so sensitive or prompt in action.', '\"The natural fore and aft stability is very much strengthened by placing\\nthe load well forward.', 'The center of gravity near the front and a\\ntail or rudder streaming to the rear secures stability as an arrow is\\nbalanced by the head and feathering.', 'The adoption of this principle\\nmakes it almost impossible for the aeroplane to turn over.', 'The Matter of Lateral Balance.', '\"All successful aeroplanes thus far have maintained lateral balance by\\nthe principle of changing the angle of incidence of the wings.', '\"Other ways of maintaining the lateral balance, suggested by observation\\nof the flight of birds are--extending the wing tips and spilling the air\\nthrough the pinions; or, what is the same thing, varying the area of the\\nwings at their extremities.', '\"Extending the wing tips seems to be a simple and effective solution of\\nthe problem.', 'The tips may be made to swing outward upon a vertical axis\\nplaced at the front edge of the main planes; or they may be hinged to\\nthe ends of the main plane so as to be elevated or depressed through\\nsuitable connections by the aviator; or they may be supported from a\\nhorizontal axis parallel with the ends of the main planes so that they\\nmay swing outward, the aviator controlling both tips through one lever\\nso that as one tip is extended the other is retracted.', '\"The elastic wing pinions of a bird bend easily before the wind,\\npermitting the gusts to glance off, but presenting always an even and\\nefficient curvature to the steady currents of the air.\"', 'High Winds Threaten Stability.', 'To ensure perfect stability, without control, either human or automatic,\\nit is asserted that the aeroplane must move faster than the wind is\\nblowing.', 'So long as the wind is blowing at the rate of 30 miles an hour,\\nand the machine is traveling 40 or more, there will be little trouble as\\nregards equilibrium so far as wind disturbance goes, provided the wind\\nblows evenly and does not come in gusts or eddying currents.', 'But when\\nconditions are reversed--when the machine travels only 30 miles an hour\\nand the wind blows at the rate of 50, look out for loss of equilibrium.', 'One of the main reasons for this is that high winds are rarely steady;\\nthey seldom blow for any length of time at the same speed.', 'They are\\nusually \"gusty,\" the gusts being a momentary movement at a higher speed.', 'Tornadic gusts are also formed by the meeting of two opposing currents,\\ncausing a whirling motion, which makes stability uncertain.', 'Besides, it\\nis not unusual for wind of high speed to suddenly change its direction\\nwithout warning.', 'Trouble With Vertical Columns.', 'Vertical currents--columns of ascending air--are frequently encountered\\nin unexpected places and have more or less tendency, according to their\\nstrength, to make it difficult to keep the machine within a reasonable\\ndistance from the ground.', 'These vertical currents are most generally noticeable in the vicinity\\nof steep cliffs, or deep ravines.', 'In such instances they are usually of\\nconsiderable strength, being caused by the deflection of strong winds\\nblowing against the face of the cliffs.', 'This deflection exerts a back\\npressure which is felt quite a distance away from the point of origin,\\nso that the vertical current exerts an influence in forcing the machine\\nupward long before the cliff is reached.', 'CHAPTER XV.', 'THE ELEMENT OF DANGER.', 'That there is an element of danger in aviation is undeniable, but it is\\nnowhere so great as the public imagines.', 'Men are killed and injured in\\nthe operation of flying machines just as they are killed and injured\\nin the operation of railways.', 'Considering the character of aviation the\\npercentage of casualties is surprisingly small.', 'This is because the results following a collapse in the air are very\\nmuch different from what might be imagined.', 'Instead of dropping to the\\nground like a bullet an aeroplane, under ordinary conditions will, when\\nanything goes wrong, sail gently downward like a parachute, particularly\\nif the operator is cool-headed and nervy enough to so manipulate the\\napparatus as to preserve its equilibrium and keep the machine on an even\\nkeel.', 'Two Fields of Safety.', 'At least one prominent aviator has declared that there are two fields\\nof safety--one close to the ground, and the other well up in the air.', 'In\\nthe first-named the fall will be a slight one with little chance of the\\noperator being seriously hurt.', 'From the field of high altitude the the\\ndescent will be gradual, as a rule, the planes of the machine serving to\\nbreak the force of the fall.', 'With a cool-headed operator in control the\\naeroplane may be even guided at an angle (about 1 to 8) in its descent\\nso as to touch the ground with a gliding motion and with a minimum of\\nimpact.', 'Such an experience, of course, is far from pleasant, but it is by no\\nmeans so dangerous as might appear.', 'There is more real danger in falling\\nfrom an elevation of 75 or 100 feet than there is from 1,000 feet, as\\nin the former case there is no chance for the machine to serve as a\\nparachute--its contact with the ground comes too quickly.', 'Lesson in Recent Accidents.', 'Among the more recent fatalities in aviation are the deaths of Antonio\\nFernandez and Leon Delagrange.', 'The former was thrown to the ground by a\\nsudden stoppage of his motor, the entire machine seeming to collapse.', 'It\\nis evident there were radical defects, not only in the motor, but in the\\naeroplane framework as well.', 'At the time of the stoppage it is\\nestimated that Fernandez was up about 1,500 feet, but the machine got\\nno opportunity to exert a parachute effect, as it broke up immediately.', 'This would indicate a fatal weakness in the structure which, under\\nproper testing, could probably have been detected before it was used in\\nflight.', 'It is hard to say it, but Delagrange appears to have been culpable to\\ngreat degree in overloading his machine with a motor equipment much\\nheavier than it was designed to sustain.', 'He was 65 feet up in the air\\nwhen the collapse occurred, resulting in his death.', 'As in the case of\\nFernandez common-sense precaution would doubtless have prevented the\\nfatality.', 'Aviation Not Extra Hazardous.', 'All told there have been, up to the time of this writing (April, 1910),\\njust five fatalities in the history of power-driven aviation.', 'This is\\nsurprisingly low when the nature of the experiments, and the fact that\\nmost of the operators were far from having extended experience, is taken\\ninto consideration.', 'Men like the Wrights, Curtiss, Bleriot, Farman,\\nPaulhan and others, are now experts, but there was a time, and it was\\nnot long ago, when they were unskilled.', 'That they, with numerous\\nothers less widely known, should have come safely through their many\\nexperiments would seem to disprove the prevailing idea that aviation is\\nan extra hazardous pursuit.', 'In the hands of careful, quick-witted, nervy men the sailing of an\\nairship should be no more hazardous than the sailing of a yacht.', 'A\\nvessel captain with common sense will not go to sea in a storm, or\\nnavigate a weak, unseaworthy craft.', 'Neither should an aviator attempt to\\nsail when the wind is high and gusty, nor with a machine which has not\\nbeen thoroughly tested and found to be strong and safe.', 'Safer Than Railroading.', 'Statistics show that some 12,000 people are killed and 72,000 injured\\nevery year on the railroads of the United States.', 'Come to think it over\\nit is small wonder that the list of fatalities is so large.', 'Trains\\nare run at high speeds, dashing over crossings at which collisions are\\nliable to occur, and over bridges which often collapse or are swept away\\nby floods.', 'Still, while the number of casualties is large, the actual\\npercentage is small considering the immense number of people involved.', 'It is so in aviation.', 'The number of casualties is remarkably small in\\ncomparison with the number of flights made.', 'In the hands of competent\\nmen the sailing of an airship should be, and is, freer from risk of\\naccident than the running of a railway train.', \"There are no rails\\nto spread or break, no bridges to collapse, no crossings at which\\ncollisions may occur, no chance for some sleepy or overworked employee\\nto misunderstand the dispatcher's orders and cause a wreck.\", 'Two Main Causes of Trouble.', 'The two main causes of trouble in an airship leading to disaster may\\nbe attributed to the stoppage of the motor, and the aviator becoming\\nrattled so that he loses control of his machine.', 'Modern ingenuity is\\nfast developing motors that almost daily become more and more reliable,\\nand experience is making aviators more and more self-confident in their\\nability to act wisely and promptly in cases of emergency.', 'Besides this\\na satisfactory system of automatic control is in a fair way of being\\nperfected.', 'Occasionally even the most experienced and competent of men in all\\ncallings become careless and by foolish action invite disaster.', 'This\\nis true of aviators the same as it is of railroaders, men who work in\\ndynamite mills, etc.', 'But in nearly every instance the responsibility\\nrests with the individual; not with the system.', 'There are some men\\nunfitted by nature for aviation, just as there are others unfitted to be\\nrailway engineers.', 'CHAPTER XVI.', 'RADICAL CHANGES BEING MADE.', 'Changes, many of them extremely radical in their nature, are continually\\nbeing made by prominent aviators, and particularly those who have won\\nthe greatest amount of success.', 'Wonderful as the results have been\\nfew of the aviators are really satisfied.', 'Their successes have merely\\nspurred them on to new endeavors, the ultimate end being the development\\nof an absolutely perfect aircraft.', 'Among the men who have been thus experimenting are the Wright Brothers,\\nwho last year (1909) brought out a craft totally different as regards\\nproportions and weight from the one used the preceding year.', 'One marked\\nresult was a gain of about 3 1/2 miles an hour in speed.', 'Dimensions of 1908 Machine.', 'The 1908 model aeroplane was 40 by 29 feet over all.', 'The carrying\\nsurfaces, that is, the two aerocurves, were 40 by 6 feet, having a\\nparabolical curve of one in twelve.', 'With about 70 square feet of surface\\nin the rudders, the total surface given was about 550 square feet.', 'The engine, which is the invention of the Wright brothers, weighed,\\napproximately, 200 pounds, and gave about 25 horsepower at 1,400\\nrevolutions per minute.', 'The total weight of the aeroplane, exclusive of\\npassenger, but inclusive of engine, was about 1,150 pounds.', 'This result\\nshowed a lift of a fraction over 2 1/4 pounds to the square foot of\\ncarrying surface.', 'The speed desired was 40 miles an hour, but the\\nmachine was found to make only a scant 39 miles an hour.', 'The upright\\nstruts were about 7/8-inch thick, the skids, 2 1/2 by 1 1/4 inches\\nthick.', 'Dimensions of 1909 Machine.', 'The 1909 aeroplane was built primarily for greater speed, and relatively\\nheavier; to be less at the mercy of the wind.', 'This result was obtained\\nas follows: The aerocurves, or carrying surfaces, were reduced in\\ndimensions from 40 by 6 feet to 36 by 5 1/2 feet, the curve remaining\\nthe same, one in twelve.', 'The upright struts were cut from seven-eighths\\ninch to five-eighths inch, and the skids from two and one-half by one\\nand one-quarter to two and one-quarter by one and three-eighths inches.', \"This result shows that there were some 81 square feet of carrying\\nsurface missing over that of last year's model.\", 'and some 25 pounds loss\\nof weight.', 'Relatively, though, the 1909 model aeroplane, while actually\\n25 pounds lighter, is really some 150 pounds heavier in the air than the\\n1908 model, owing to the lesser square feet of carrying surface.', 'Some of the Results Obtained.', 'Reducing the carrying surfaces from 6 to 5 1/2 feet gave two\\nresults--first, less carrying capacity; and, second, less head-on\\nresistance, owing to the fact that the extent of the parabolic curve\\nin the carrying surfaces was shortened.', 'The \"head-on\" resistance is\\nthe retardance the aeroplane meets in passing through the air, and is\\ncounted in square feet.', 'In the 1908 model the curve being one in twelve\\nand 6 feet deep, gave 6 inches of head-on resistance.', 'The plane being\\n40 feet spread, gave 6 inches by 40 feet, or 20 square feet of head-on\\nresistance.', 'Increasing this figure by a like amount for each plane, and\\nadding approximately 10 square feet for struts, skids and wiring, we\\nhave a total of approximately, 50 square feet of surface for \"head-on\"\\nresistance.', 'In the 1909 aeroplane, shortening the curve 6 inches at the parabolic\\nend of the curve took off 1 inch of head-on resistance.', 'Shortening the\\nspread of the planes took off between 3 and 4 square feet of head-on\\nresistance.', 'Add to this the total of 7 square feet, less curve surface\\nand about 1 square foot, less wire and woodwork resistance, and we\\nhave a grand total of, approximately, 12 square feet of less \"head-on\"\\nresistance over the 1908 model.', 'Changes in Engine Action.', 'The engine used in 1909 was the same one used in 1908, though some minor\\nchanges were made as improvements; for instance, a make and break spark\\nwas used, and a nine-tooth, instead of a ten-tooth magneto gear-wheel\\nwas used.', 'This increased the engine revolutions per minute from 1,200 to\\n1,400, and the propeller revolutions per minute from 350 to 371, giving\\na propeller thrust of, approximately, 170 foot pounds instead of 153, as\\nwas had last year.', 'More Speed and Same Capacity.', 'One unsatisfactory feature of the 1909 model over that of 1908,\\napparently, was the lack of inherent lateral stability.', 'This was caused\\nby the lesser surface and lesser extent of curvatures at the portions\\nof the aeroplane which were warped.', 'This defect did not show so plainly\\nafter Mr. Orville Wright had become fully proficient in the handling of\\nthe new machine, and with skillful management, the 1909 model aeroplane\\nwill be just as safe and secure as the other though it will take a\\nlittle more practice to get that same degree of skill.', 'To sum up: The aeroplane used in 1909 was 25 pounds lighter, but really\\nabout 150 pounds heavier in the air, had less head-on resistance, and\\ngreater propeller thrust.', 'The speed was increased from about 39 miles\\nper hour to 42 1/2 miles per hour.', 'The lifting capacity remained about\\nthe same, about 450 pounds capacity passenger-weight, with the 1908\\nmachine.', 'In this respect, the loss of carrying surface was compensated\\nfor by the increased speed.', 'During the first few flights it was plainly demonstrated that it would\\nneed the highest skill to properly handle the aeroplane, as first one\\nend and then the other would dip and strike the ground, and either tear\\nthe canvas or slew the aeroplane around and break a skid.', 'Wrights Adopt Wheeled Gears.', 'In still another important respect the Wrights, so far as the output\\nof one of their companies goes, have made a radical change.', 'All the\\naeroplanes turned out by the Deutsch Wright Gesellschaft, according to\\nthe German publication, _Automobil-Welt_, will hereafter be equipped\\nwith wheeled running gears and tails.', 'The plan of this new machine is\\nshown in the illustration on page 145.', 'The wheels are three in number,\\nand are attached one to each of the two skids, just under the front edge\\nof the planes, and one forward of these, attached to a cross-member.', 'It\\nis asserted that with these wheels the teaching of purchasers to operate\\nthe machines is much simplified, as the beginners can make short flights\\non their own account without using the starting derrick.', 'This is a big concession for the Wrights to make, as they have hitherto\\nadhered stoutly to the skid gear.', 'While it is true they do not control\\nthe German company producing their aeroplanes, yet the nature of their\\nconnection with the enterprise is such that it may be taken for granted\\nno radical changes in construction would be made without their approval\\nand consent.', 'Only Three Dangerous Rivals.', 'Official trials with the 1909 model smashed many records and leave the\\nWright brothers with only three dangerous rivals in the field, and with\\nbasic patents which cover the curve, warp and wing-tip devices found on\\nall the other makes of aeroplanes.', 'These three rivals are the Curtiss\\nand Voisin biplane type and the Bleriot monoplane pattern.', 'The Bleriot monoplane is probably the most dangerous rival, as this make\\nof machine has a record of 54 miles per hour, has crossed the English\\nchannel, and has lifted two passengers besides the operator.', 'The\\nlatest type of this machine only weighs 771.61 pounds complete, without\\npassengers, and will lift a total passenger weight of 462.97 pounds,\\nwhich is a lift of 5.21 pounds to the square foot.', 'This is a better\\nresult than those published by the Wright brothers, the best noted being\\n4.25 pounds per square foot.', 'Other Aviators at Work.', 'The Wrights, however, are not alone in their efforts to promote the\\nefficiency of the flying machine.', 'Other competent inventive aviators,\\nnotably Curtiss, Voisin, Bleriot and Farman, are close after them.', 'The\\nWrights, as stated, have a marked advantage in the possession of\\npatents covering surface plane devices which have thus far been found\\nindispensable in flying machine construction.', 'Numerous law suits growing\\nout of alleged infringements of these patents have been started, and\\nothers are threatened.', 'What effect these actions will have in deterring\\naviators in general from proceeding with their experiments remains to be\\nseen.', 'In the meantime the four men named--Curtiss, Voisin, Bleriot and\\nFarman--are going ahead regardless of consequences, and the inventive\\ngenius of each is so strong that it is reasonable to expect some\\nremarkable developments in the near future.', 'Smallest of Flying Machines.', 'To Santos Dumont must be given the credit of producing the smallest\\npractical flying machine yet constructed.', 'True, he has done nothing\\nremarkable with it in the line of speed, but he has demonstrated the\\nfact that a large supporting surface is not an essential feature.', 'This machine is named \"La Demoiselle.\"', 'It is a monoplane of the dihedral\\ntype, with a main plane on each side of the center.', 'These main\\nplanes are of 18 foot spread, and nearly 6 1/2 feet in depth, giving\\napproximately 115 feet of surface area.', 'The total weight is 242\\npounds, which is 358 pounds less than any other machine which has been\\nsuccessfully used.', 'The total depth from front to rear is 26 feet.', 'The framework is of bamboo, strengthened and held taut with wire guys.', 'Have One Rule in Mind.', 'In this struggle for mastery in flying machine efficiency all the\\ncontestants keep one rule in mind, and this is:\\n\\n\"The carrying capacity of an aeroplane is governed by the peripheral\\ncurve of its carrying surfaces, plus the speed; and the speed\\nis governed by the thrust of the propellers, less the \\'head-on\\'\\nresistance.\"', 'Their ideas as to the proper means of approaching the proposition\\nmay, and undoubtedly are, at variance, but the one rule in solving the\\nproblem of obtaining the greatest carrying capacity combined with the\\ngreatest speed, obtains in all instances.', 'CHAPTER XVII.', 'SOME OF THE NEW DESIGNS.', 'Spurred on by the success attained by the more experienced and better\\nknown aviators numerous inventors of lesser fame are almost daily\\nproducing practical flying machines varying radically in construction\\nfrom those now in general use.', 'One of these comparatively new designs is the Van Anden biplane, made\\nby Frank Van Anden of Islip, Long Island, a member of the New York\\nAeronautic Society.', 'While his machine is wholly experimental, many\\nsuccessful short flights were made with it last fall (1909).', 'One flight,\\nmade October 19th, 1909, is of particular interest as showing the\\npracticability of an automatic stabilizing device installed by the\\ninventor.', 'The machine was caught in a sudden severe gust of wind and\\nkeeled over, but almost immediately righted itself, thus demonstrating\\nin a most satisfactory manner the value of one new attachment.', 'Features of Van Anden Model.', 'In size the surfaces of the main biplane are 26 feet in spread, and 4\\nfeet in depth from front to rear.', 'The upper and lower planes are 4 feet\\napart.', 'Silkolene coated with varnish is used for the coverings.', 'Ribs\\n(spruce) are curved one inch to the foot, the deepest part of the curve\\n(4 inches) being one foot back from the front edge of the horizontal\\nbeam.', 'Struts (also of spruce, as is all the framework) are elliptical in\\nshape.', 'The main beams are in three sections, nearly half round in form,\\nand joined by metal sleeves.', 'There is a two-surface horizontal rudder, 2x2x4 feet, in front.', 'This\\nis pivoted at its lateral center 8 feet from the front edge of the main\\nplanes.', 'In the rear is another two-surface horizontal rudder 2x2x2 1/2\\nfeet, pivoted in the same manner as the front one, 15 feet from the rear\\nedges of the main planes.', 'Hinged to the rear central strut of the rear rudder is a vertical rudder\\n2 feet high by 3 feet in length.', 'The Method of Control.', 'In the operation of these rudders--both front and rear--and the\\nelevation and depression of the main planes, the Curtiss system is\\nemployed.', 'Pushing the steering-wheel post outward depresses the front\\nedges of the planes, and brings the machine downward; pulling the\\nsteering-wheel post inward elevates the front edges of the planes and\\ncauses the machine to ascend.', 'Turning the steering wheel itself to the right swings the tail rudder to\\nthe left, and the machine, obeying this like a boat, turns in the same\\ndirection as the wheel is turned.', 'By like cause turning the wheel to the\\nleft turns the machine to the left.', 'Automatic Control of Wings.', 'There are two wing tips, each of 6 feet spread (length) and 2 feet from\\nfront to rear.', 'These are hinged half way between the main surfaces to\\nthe two outermost rear struts.', 'Cables run from these to an automatic\\ndevice working with power from the engine, which automatically operates\\nthe tips with the tilting of the machine.', 'Normally the wing tips are\\nheld horizontal by stiff springs introduced in the cables outside of the\\ndevice.', 'It was the successful working of this device which righted the Van\\nAnden craft when it was overturned in the squall of October 19th, 1909.', 'Previous to that occurrence Mr. Van Anden had looked upon the device as\\npurely experimental, and had admitted that he had grave uncertainty as\\nto how it would operate in time of emergency.', 'He is now quoted as being\\nthoroughly satisfied with its practicability.', 'It is this automatic\\ndevice which gives the Van Anden machine at least one distinctively new\\nfeature.', 'While on this subject it will not be amiss to add that Mr. Curtiss does\\nnot look kindly on automatic control.', '\"I would rather trust to my own\\naction than that of a machine,\" he says.', 'This is undoubtedly good\\nlogic so far as Mr. Curtiss is concerned, but all aviators are not so\\ncool-headed and resourceful.', 'Motive Power of Van Anden.', 'A 50-horsepower \"H-F\" water cooled motor drives a laminated wood\\npropeller 6 feet in diameter, with a 17 degree pitch at the extremities,\\nincreasing toward the hub.', 'The rear end of the motor is about 6 inches\\nback from the rear transverse beam and the engine shaft is in a direct\\nline with the axes of the two horizontal rudders.', 'An R. I. V. ball\\nbearing carries the shaft at this point.', 'Flying, the motor turns at\\nabout 800 revolutions per minute, delivering 180 pounds pull.', 'A test of\\nthe motor running at 1,200 showed a pull of 250 pounds on the scales.', 'Still Another New Aeroplane.', 'Another new aeroplane is that produced by A. M. Herring (an old-timer)\\nand W. S. Burgess, under the name of the Herring-Burgess.', 'This is also\\nequipped with an automatic stability device for maintaining the balance\\ntransversely.', 'The curvature of the planes is also laid out on new\\nlines.', 'That this new plan is effective is evidenced by the fact that the\\nmachine has been elevated to an altitude of 40 feet by using one-half\\nthe power of the 30-horsepower motor.', 'The system of rudder and elevation control is very simple.', 'The aviator\\nsits in front of the lower plane, and extending his arms, grasps two\\nsupports which extend down diagonally in front.', 'On the under side of\\nthese supports just beneath his fingers are the controls which operate\\nthe vertical rudder, in the rear.', 'Thus, if he wishes to turn to the\\nright, he presses the control under the fingers of his right hand; if to\\nthe left, that under the fingers of his left hand.', \"The elevating rudder\\nis operated by the aviator's right foot, the control being placed on a\\nfoot-rest.\", 'Motor Is Extremely Light.', 'Not the least notable feature of the craft is its motor.', 'Although\\ndeveloping, under load, 30-horsepower, or that of an ordinary\\nautomobile, it weighs, complete, hardly 100 pounds.', 'Having occasion to\\nmove it a little distance for inspection, Mr. Burgess picked it up and\\nwalked off with it--cylinders, pistons, crankcase and all, even the\\nmagneto, being attached.', 'There are not many 30-horsepower engines which\\ncan be so handled.', 'Everything about it is reduced to its lowest terms\\nof simplicity, and hence, of weight.', 'A single camshaft operates not\\nonly all of the inlet and exhaust valves, but the magneto and gear water\\npump, as well.', 'The motor is placed directly behind the operator, and the\\npropeller is directly mounted on the crankshaft.', 'This weight of less than 100 pounds, it must be remembered, is not for\\nthe motor alone; it includes the entire power plant equipment.', 'The \"thrust\" of the propeller is also extraordinary, being between 250\\nand 260 pounds.', 'The force of the wind displacement is strong enough to\\nknock down a good-sized boy as one youngster ascertained when he got\\nbehind the propeller as it was being tested.', 'He was not only knocked\\ndown but driven for some distance away from the machine.', 'The propeller\\nhas four blades which are but little wider than a lath.', 'Machine Built by Students.', 'Students at the University of Pennsylvania, headed by Laurence J. Lesh,\\na protege of Octave Chanute, have constructed a practical aeroplane of\\nordinary maximum size, in which is incorporated many new ideas.', 'The most\\nunique of these is to be found in the steering gear, and the provision\\nmade for the accommodation of a pupil while taking lessons under an\\nexperienced aviator.', 'Immediately back of the aviator is an extra seat and an extra steering\\nwheel which works in tandem style with the front wheel.', 'By this\\narrangement a beginner may be easily and quickly taught to have\\nperfect control of the machine.', 'These tandem wheels are also handy for\\npassengers who may wish to operate the car independently of one another,\\nit being understood, of course, that there will be no conflict of\\naction.', 'Frame Size and Engine Power.', 'The frame has 36 feet spread and measures 35 feet from the front edge to\\nthe end of the tail in the rear.', 'It is equipped with two rear propellers\\noperated by a Ramsey 8-cylinder motor of 50 horsepower, placed\\nhorizontally across the lower plane, with the crank shaft running clear\\nthrough the engine.', 'The \"Pennsylvania I\" is the first two-propeller biplane chainless\\ncar, this scheme having been adopted in order to avoid the crossing of\\nchains.', 'The lateral control is by a new invention by Octave Chanute\\nand Laurence J. Lesh, for which Lesh is now applying for a patent.', \"The\\ndevice was worked out before the Wright brothers' suit was begun, and is\\nsaid to be superior to the Wright warping or the Curtiss ailerons.\", 'The\\nlanding device is also new in design.', 'This aeroplane will weigh about\\n1,500 pounds, and will carry fuel for a flight of 150 miles, and it is\\nexpected to attain a speed of at least 45 miles an hour.', 'There are others, lots of them, too numerous in fact to admit of mention\\nin a book of this size.', 'CHAPTER XVIII.', 'DEMAND FOR FLYING MACHINES.', 'As a commercial proposition the manufacture and sale of motor-equipped\\naeroplanes is making much more rapid advance than at first obtained in\\nthe similar handling of the automobile.', 'Great, and even phenomenal,\\nas was the commercial development of the motor car, that of the flying\\nmachine is even greater.', 'This is a startling statement, but it is fully\\nwarranted by the facts.', 'It is barely more than a year ago (1909) that attention was seriously\\nattracted to the motor-equipped aeroplane as a vehicle possible of\\nmanipulation by others than professional aviators.', 'Up to that time\\nsuch actual flights as were made were almost exclusively with the sole\\npurpose of demonstrating the practicability of the machine, and the\\nmerits of the ideas as to shape, engine power, etc., of the various\\nproducers.', \"Results of Bleriot's Daring.\", 'It was not until Bleriot flew across the straits of Dover on July 25th,\\n1909, that the general public awoke to a full realization of the fact\\nthat it was possible for others than professional aviators to indulge\\nin aviation.', \"Bleriot's feat was accepted as proof that at last\\nan absolutely new means of sport, pleasure and research, had been\\npractically developed, and was within the reach of all who had the\\ninclination, nerve and financial means to adopt it.\", 'From this event may be dated the birth of the modern flying machine into\\nthe world of business.', 'The automobile was taken up by the general public\\nfrom the very start because it was a proposition comparatively easy of\\ndemonstration.', 'There was nothing mysterious or uncanny in the fact that\\na wheeled vehicle could be propelled on solid, substantial roads by\\nmeans of engine power.', 'And yet it took (comparatively speaking) a long\\ntime to really popularize the motor car.', 'Wonderful Results in a Year.', 'Men of large financial means engaged in the manufacture of automobiles,\\nand expended fortunes in attracting public attention to them through the\\nmedium of advertisements, speed and road contests, etc.', 'By these means\\na mammoth business has been built up, but bringing this business to its\\npresent proportions required years of patient industry and indomitable\\npluck.', 'At this writing, less than a year from the day when Bleriot crossed the\\nchannel, the actual sales of flying machines outnumber the actual sales\\nof automobiles in the first year of their commercial development.', 'This\\nmay appear incredible, but it is a fact as statistics will show.', 'In this connection we should take into consideration the fact that up to\\na year ago there was no serious intention of putting flying machines\\non the market; no preparations had been made to produce them on a\\ncommercial scale; no money had been expended in advertisements with a\\nview to selling them.', 'Some of the Actual Results.', 'Today flying machines are being produced on a commercial basis, and\\nthere is a big demand for them.', 'The people making them are overcrowded\\nwith orders.', 'Some of the producers are already making arrangements to\\nenlarge their plants and advertise their product for sale the same as\\nis being done with automobiles, while a number of flying machine motor\\nmakers are already promoting the sale of their wares in this way.', 'Here are a few actual figures of flying machine sales made by the more\\nprominent producers since July 25th, 1909.', 'Santos Dumont, 90 machines; Bleriot, 200; Farman, 130;\\nClemenceau-Wright, 80; Voisin, 100; Antoinette, 100.', 'Many of these\\norders have been filled by delivery of the machines, and in others the\\nconstruction work is under way.', 'The foregoing are all of foreign make.', 'In this country Curtiss and the\\nWrights are engaged in similar work, but no actual figures of their\\noutput are obtainable.', 'Larger Plants Are Necessary.', 'And this situation exists despite the fact that none of the producers\\nare really equipped with adequate plants for turning out their\\nmachines on a modern, business-like basis.', 'The demand was so sudden and\\nunexpected that it found them poorly prepared to meet it.', 'This, however,\\nis now being remedied by the erection of special plants, the enlargement\\nof others, and the introduction of new machinery and other labor-saving\\nconveniences.', 'Companies, with large capitalization, to engage in the exclusive\\nproduction of airships are being organized in many parts of the world.', 'One notable instance of this nature is worth quoting as illustrative\\nof the manner in which the production of flying machines is being\\ncommercialized.', 'This is the formation at Frankfort, Germany, of the\\nFlugmaschine Wright, G. m. b. H., with a capital of $119,000, the\\nKrupps, of Essen, being interested.', 'Prices at Which Machines Sell.', 'This wonderful demand from the public has come notwithstanding the fact\\nthat the machines, owing to lack of facilities for wholesale production,\\nare far from being cheap.', 'Such definite quotations as are made are on\\nthe following basis:\\n\\nSantos Dumont--List price $1,000, but owing to the rush of orders agents\\nare readily getting from $1,300 to $1,500.', 'This is the smallest machine\\nmade.', 'Bleriot--List price $2,500.', 'This is for the cross-channel type, with\\nAnzani motor.', 'Antoinette--List price from $4,000 to $5,000, according to size.', 'Wright--List price $5,600.', 'Curtiss--List price $5,000.', 'There is, however, no stability in prices as purchasers are almost\\ninvariably ready to pay a considerable premium to facilitate delivery.', 'The motor is the most expensive part of the flying machine.', 'Motor\\nprices range from $500 to $2,000, this latter amount being asked for the\\nCurtiss engine.', 'Systematic Instruction of Amateurs.', 'In addition to the production of flying machines many of the experienced\\naviators are making a business of the instruction of amateurs.', 'Curtiss\\nand the Wrights in this country have a number of pupils, as have also\\nthe prominent foreigners.', 'Schools of instruction are being opened in\\nvarious parts of the world, not alone as private money-making ventures,\\nbut in connection with public educational institutions.', 'One of these\\nlatter is to be found at the University of Barcelona, Spain.', 'The flying machine agent, the man who handles the machines on a\\ncommission, has also become a known quantity, and will soon be as\\nnumerous as his brother of the automobile.', 'The sign \"John Bird, agent\\nfor Skimmer\\'s Flying Machine,\" is no longer a curiosity.', 'Yes, the Airship Is Here.', 'From all of which we may well infer that the flying machine in practical\\nform has arrived, and that it is here to stay.', 'It is no exaggeration to\\nsay that the time is close at hand when people will keep flying machines\\njust as they now keep automobiles, and that pleasure jaunts will be\\nfully as numerous and popular.', 'With the important item of practicability\\nfully demonstrated, \"Come, take a trip in my airship,\" will have more\\nreal significance than now attaches to the vapid warblings of the\\nvaudeville vocalist.', 'As a further evidence that the airship is really here, and that its\\npresence is recognized in a business way, the action of life and\\naccident insurance companies is interesting.', 'Some of them are\\nreconstructing their policies so as to include a special waiver of\\ninsurance by aviators.', 'Anything which compels these great corporations\\nto modify their policies cannot be looked upon as a mere curiosity or\\ntoy.', 'It is some consolation to know that the movement in this direction is\\nnot thus far widespread.', 'Moreover it is more than probable that the\\ncompetition for business will eventually induce the companies to act\\nmore liberally toward aviators, especially as the art of aviation\\nadvances.', 'CHAPTER XIX.', 'LAW OF THE AIRSHIP.', 'Successful aviation has evoked some peculiar things in the way of legal\\naction and interpretation of the law.', \"It is well understood that a man's property cannot be used without his\\nconsent.\", 'This is an old established principle in common law which holds\\ngood today.', \"The limits of a man's property lines, however, have not been so well\\nunderstood by laymen.\", 'According to eminent legal authorities such as\\nBlackstone, Littleton and Coke, the \"fathers of the law,\" the owner of\\nrealty also holds title above and below the surface, and this theory is\\ngenerally accepted without question by the courts.', 'Rights of Property Owners.', 'In other words the owner of realty also owns the sky above it without\\nlimit as to distance.', 'He can dig as deep into his land, or go as high\\ninto the air as he desires, provided he does not trespass upon or injure\\nsimilar rights of others.', 'The owner of realty may resist by force, all other means having failed,\\nany trespass upon, or invasion of his property.', 'Other people, for\\ninstance, may not enter upon it, or over or under it, without his\\nexpress permission and consent.', 'There is only one exception, and this is\\nin the case of public utility corporations such as railways which,\\nunder the law of eminent domain, may condemn a right of way across the\\nproperty of an obstinate owner who declines to accept a fair price for\\nthe privilege.', 'Privilege Sharply Confined.', 'The law of eminent domain may be taken advantage of only by corporations\\nwhich are engaged in serving the public.', 'It is based upon the principle\\nthat the advancement and improvement of a community is of more\\nimportance and carries with it more rights than the interests of the\\nindividual owner.', \"But even in cases where the right of eminent domain is\\nexercised there can be no confiscation of the individual's property.\", 'Exercising the right of eminent domain is merely obtaining by public\\npurchase what is held to be essential to the public good, and which\\ncannot be secured by private purchase.', 'When eminent domain proceedings\\nare resorted to the court appoints appraisers who determine upon the\\nvalue of the property wanted, and this value (in money) is paid to the\\nowner.', 'How It Affects Aviation.', 'It should be kept in mind that this privilege of the \"right of eminent\\ndomain\" is accorded only to corporations which are engaged in serving\\nthe public.', 'Individuals cannot take advantage of it.', 'Thus far all\\naviation has been conducted by individuals; there are no flying machine\\nor airship corporations regularly engaged in the transportation of\\npassengers, mails or freight.', 'This leads up to the question \"What would happen if realty owners\\ngenerally, or in any considerable numbers, should prohibit the\\nnavigation of the air above their holdings?\"', 'It is idle to say such\\na possibility is ridiculous--it is already an actuality in a few\\nindividual instances.', 'One property owner in New Jersey, a justice of the peace, maintains a\\nlarge sign on the roof of his house warning aviators that they must not\\ntrespass upon his domain.', 'That he is acting well within his rights in\\ndoing this is conceded by legal authorities.', 'Hard to Catch Offenders.', 'But, suppose the alleged trespass is committed, what is the property\\nowner going to do about it?', 'He must first catch the trespasser and this\\nwould be a pretty hard job.', 'He certainly could not overtake him, unless\\nhe kept a racing aeroplane for this special purpose.', 'It would be\\nequally difficult to identify the offender after the offense had been\\ncommitted, even if he were located, as aeroplanes carry no license\\nnumbers.', 'Allowing that the offender should be caught the only recourse of the\\nrealty owner is an action for damages.', 'He may prevent the commission of\\nthe offense by force if necessary, but after it is committed he can only\\nsue for damages.', 'And in doing this he would have a lot of trouble.', 'Points to Be Proven.', 'One of the first things the plaintiff would be called upon to prove\\nwould be the elevation of the machine.', 'If it were reasonably close to\\nthe ground there would, of course, be grave risk of damage to fences,\\nshrubbery, and other property, and the court would be justified in\\nholding it to be a nuisance that should be suppressed.', \"If, on the other hand; the machine was well up in the air, but going\\nslowly, or hovering over the plaintiff's property, the court might be\\ninclined to rule that it could not possibly be a nuisance, but right\\nhere the court would be in serious embarrassment.\", \"By deciding that it\\nwas not a nuisance he would virtually override the law against invasion\\nof a man's property without his consent regardless of the nature of the\\ninvasion.\", 'By the same decision he would also say in effect that, if one\\nflying machine could do this a dozen or more would have equal right to\\ndo the same thing.', 'While one machine hovering over a certain piece of\\nproperty may be no actual nuisance a dozen or more in the same position\\ncould hardly be excused.', 'Difficult to Fix Damages.', 'Such a condition would tend to greatly increase the risk of accident,\\neither through collision, or by the carelessness of the aviators in\\ndropping articles which might cause damages to the people or property\\nbelow.', 'In such a case it would undoubtedly be a nuisance, and in\\naddition to a fine, the offender would also be liable for the damages.', 'Taking it for granted that no actual damage is done, and the owner\\nmerely sues on account of the invasion of his property, how is the\\namount of compensation to be fixed upon?', 'The owner has lost nothing; no\\npart of his possessions has been taken away; nothing has been injured\\nor destroyed; everything is left in exactly the same condition as before\\nthe invasion.', 'And yet, if the law is strictly interpreted, the offender\\nis liable.', 'Right of Way for Airships.', 'Somebody has suggested the organization of flying-machine corporations\\nas common carriers, which would give them the right of eminent domain\\nwith power to condemn a right of way.', 'But what would they condemn?', 'There\\nis nothing tangible in the air.', 'Railways in condemning a right of way\\nspecify tangible property (realty) within certain limits.', 'How would an\\naviator designate any particular right of way through the air a certain\\nnumber of feet in width, and a certain distance from the ground?', 'And yet, should the higher courts hold to the letter of the law and\\ndecide that aviators have no right to navigate their craft over private\\nproperty, something will have to be done to get them out of the dilemma,\\nas aviation is too far advanced to be discarded.', 'Fortunately there is\\nlittle prospect of any widespread antagonism among property owners so\\nlong as aviators refrain from making nuisances of themselves.', 'Possible Solution Offered.', \"One possible solution is offered and that is to confine the path of\\nairships to the public highways so that nobody's property rights would\\nbe invaded.\", 'In addition, as a matter of promoting safety for both\\noperators and those who may happen to be beneath the airships as they\\npass over a course, adoption of the French rules are suggested.', 'These\\nare as follows:\\n\\nAeroplanes, when passing, must keep to the right, and pass at a distance\\nof at least 150 feet.', 'They are free from this rule when flying at\\naltitudes of more than 100 feet.', 'Every machine when flying at night or\\nduring foggy weather must carry a green light on the right, and a red\\nlight on the left, and a white headlight on the front.', 'These are sensible rules, but may be improved upon by the addition of a\\nsignal system of some kind, either horn, whistle or bell.', 'Responsibility of Aviators.', 'Mr. Jay Carver Bossard, in recent numbers of _Fly_, brings out some\\ncurious and interesting legal points in connection with aviation, among\\nwhich are the following:\\n\\n\"Private parties who possess aerial craft, and desire to operate the\\nsame in aerial territory other than their own, must obtain from land\\nowners special permission to do so, such permission to be granted only\\nby agreement, founded upon a valid consideration.', \"Otherwise, passing\\nover another's land will in each instance amount to a trespass.\", '\"Leaving this highly technical side of the question, let us turn to\\nanother view: the criminal and tort liability of owners and operators to\\nairship passengers.', \"If A invites B to make an ascension with him in his\\nmachine, and B, knowing that A is merely an enthusiastic amateur and\\nfar from being an expert, accepts and is through A's innocent negligence\\ninjured, he has no grounds for recovery.\", 'But if A contracts with B, to\\ntransport him from one place to another, for a consideration, and B is\\ninjured by the poor piloting of A, A would be liable to B for damages\\nwhich would result.', 'Now in order to safeguard such people as B, curious\\nto the point of recklessness, the law will have to require all airship\\noperators to have a license, and to secure this license airship pilots\\nwill have to meet certain requirements.', 'Here again is a question.', 'Who\\nis going to say whether an applicant is competent to pilot a balloon or\\nairship?', 'Fine for an Aeronaut.', '\"An aeroplane while maneuvering is suddenly caught by a treacherous gale\\nand swept to the ground.', \"A crowd of people hasten over to see if the\\naeronaut is injured, and in doing so trample over Tax-payer Smith's\\ngarden, much to the detriment of his growing vegetables and flowers.\", 'Who\\nis liable for the damages?', \"Queer as it may seem, a case very similar to\\nthis was decided in 1823, in the New York supreme court, and it was held\\nthat the aeronaut was liable upon the following grounds: 'To render one\\nman liable in trespass for the acts of others, it must appear either\\nthat they acted in concert, or that the act of the one, ordinarily and\\nnaturally produced the acts of the others, Ascending in a balloon is not\\nan unlawful act, but it is certain that the aeronaut has no control\\nover its motion horizontally, but is at the sport of the wind, and is\\nto descend when and how he can.\", 'His reaching the earth is a matter of\\nhazard.', \"If his descent would according to the circumstances draw a crowd\\nof people around him, either out of curiosity, or for the purpose\\nof rescuing him from a perilous situation, all this he ought to have\\nforeseen, and must be responsible for.'\", 'Air Not Really Free.', '\"The general belief among people is, that the air is free.', 'Not only free\\nto breathe and enjoy, but free to travel in, and that no one has any\\ndefinite jurisdiction over, or in any part of it.', 'Now suppose this were\\nmade a legal doctrine.', 'Would a murder perpetrated above the clouds have\\nto go unpunished?', 'Undoubtedly.', 'For felonies committed upon the high seas\\nample provision is made for their punishment, but new provisions will\\nhave to be made for crimes committed in the air.', 'Relations of Owner and Employee.', '\"It is a general rule of law that a master is bound to provide\\nreasonably safe tools, appliances and machines for his servant.', 'How this\\nrule is going to be applied in cases of aeroplanes, remains to be seen.', 'The aeroplane owner who hires a professional aeronaut, that is, one who\\nhas qualified as an expert, owes him very little legal duty to supply\\nhim with a perfect aeroplane.', 'The expert is supposed to know as much\\nregarding the machine as the owner, if not more, and his acceptance of\\nhis position relieves the owner from liability.', 'When the owner hires an\\namateur aeronaut to run the aeroplane, and teaches him how to manipulate\\nit, even though the prescribed manner of manipulation will make flight\\nsafe, nevertheless if the machine is visibly defective, or known to be\\nso, any injury which results to the aeronaut the owner is liable for.', 'As to Aeroplane Contracts.', '\"At the present time there are many orders being placed with aeroplane\\nmanufacturing companies.', 'There are some unique questions to be raised\\nhere under the law of contract.', 'It is an elementary principle of law\\nthat no one can be compelled to complete a contract which in itself is\\nimpossible to perform.', 'For instance, a contract to row a boat across\\nthe Atlantic in two weeks, for a consideration, could never be enforced\\nbecause it is within judicial knowledge that such an undertaking is\\nbeyond human power.', 'Again, contracts formed for the doing of acts\\ncontrary to nature are never enforcible, and here is where our\\ndifficulty comes in.', 'Is it possible to build a machine or species of\\ncraft which will transport a person or goods through the air?', 'The courts\\nknow that balloons are practical; that is, they know that a bag\\nfilled with gas has a lifting power and can move through the air at an\\nappreciable

for injury\\nwould be very limited.\", 'No Redress for Purchasers.', '\"In the case of giving warranties on aeroplanes, we have yet to see just\\nwhat a court is going to say.', 'It is easy enough for a manufacturer to\\nguarantee to build a machine of certain dimensions and according to\\ncertain specifications, but when he inserts a clause in the contract to\\nthe effect that the machine will raise itself from the surface of the\\nearth, defy the laws of gravity, and soar in the heavens at the will of\\nthe aviator, he is to say the least contracting to perform a miracle.', '\"Until aeroplanes have been made and accepted as practical, no court\\nwill force a manufacturer to turn out a machine guaranteed to fly.', \"So\\npurchasers can well remember that if their machines refuse to fly they\\nhave no redress against the maker, for he can always say, 'The industry\\nis still in its experimental stage.'\", 'In contracting for an engine no\\nbuilder will guarantee that the

southern climes\\nand occasionally seen in northerly latitudes in summer, which has\\nnever been thoroughly explained.', 'It is the soaring or sailing flight\\nof certain varieties of large birds who transport themselves on rigid,\\nunflapping wings in any desired direction; who in winds of 6 to 20\\nmiles per hour, circle, rise, advance, return and remain aloft for hours\\nwithout a beat of wing, save for getting under way or convenience in\\nvarious maneuvers.', 'They appear to obtain from the wind alone all the\\nnecessary energy, even to advancing dead against that wind.', 'This feat is\\nso much opposed to our general ideas of physics that those who have\\nnot seen it sometimes deny its actuality, and those who have only\\noccasionally witnessed it subsequently doubt the evidence of their own\\neyes.', 'Others, who have seen the exceptional performances, speculate on\\nvarious explanations, but the majority give it up as a sort of \"negative\\ngravity.\"', 'Soaring Power of Birds.', 'The writer of this paper published in the \"Aeronautical Annual\" for 1896\\nand 1897 an article upon the sailing flight of birds, in which he gave\\na list of the authors who had described such flight or had advanced\\ntheories for its explanation, and he passed these in review.', 'He also\\ndescribed his own observations and submitted some computations to\\naccount for the observed facts.', 'These computations were correct as\\nfar as they went, but they were scanty.', 'It was, for instance, shown\\nconvincingly by analysis that a gull weighing 2.188 pounds, with a total\\nsupporting surface of 2.015 square feet, a maximum body cross-section\\nof 0.126 square feet and a maximum cross-section of wing edges of 0.098\\nsquare feet, patrolling on rigid wings (soaring) on the weather side of\\na steamer and maintaining an upward angle or attitude of 5 degrees to 7\\ndegrees above the horizon, in a wind blowing 12.78 miles an hour, which\\nwas deflected upward 10 degrees to 20 degrees by the side of the steamer\\n(these all being carefully observed facts), was perfectly sustained at\\nits own \"relative speed\" of 17.88 miles per hour and extracted from\\nthe upward trend of the wind sufficient energy to overcome all the\\nresistances, this energy amounting to 6.44 foot-pounds per second.', 'Great Power of Gulls.', 'It was shown that the same bird in flapping flight in calm air, with an\\nattitude or incidence of 3 degrees to 5 degrees above the horizon and\\na speed of 20.4 miles an hour was well sustained and expended 5.88\\nfoot-pounds per second, this being at the rate of 204 pounds sustained\\nper horsepower.', 'It was stated also that a gull in its observed\\nmaneuvers, rising up from a pile head on unflapping wings, then plunging\\nforward against the wind and subsequently rising higher than his\\nstarting point, must either time his ascents and descents exactly with\\nthe variations in wind velocities, or must meet a wind billow rotating\\non a horizontal axis and come to a poise on its crest, thus availing of\\nan ascending trend.', 'But the observations failed to demonstrate that the variations of the\\nwind gusts and the movements of the bird were absolutely synchronous,\\nand it was conjectured that the peculiar shape of the soaring wing of\\ncertain birds, as differentiated from the flapping wing, might, when\\nexperimented upon, hereafter account for the performance.', 'Mystery to be Explained.', 'These computations, however satisfactory they were for the speed of\\nwinds observed, failed to account for the observed spiral soaring of\\nbuzzards in very light winds and the writer was compelled to confess:\\n\"Now, this spiral soaring in steady breezes of 5 to 10 miles per hour\\nwhich are apparently horizontal, and through which the bird maintains an\\naverage speed of about 20 miles an hour, is the mystery to be explained.', \"It is not accounted for, quantitatively, by any of the theories which\\nhave been advanced, and it is the one performance which has led some\\nobservers to claim that it was done through 'aspiration.'\", 'i, e., that\\na bird acted upon by a current, actually drew forward into that current\\nagainst its exact direction of motion.\"', 'Buzzards Soar in Dead Calm.', 'A still greater mystery was propounded by the few observers who asserted\\nthat they had seen buzzards soaring in a dead calm, maintaining their\\nelevation and their speed.', 'Among these observers was Mr. E. C. Huffaker,\\nat one time assistant experimenter for Professor Langley.', 'The writer\\nbelieved and said then that he must in some way have been mistaken, yet,\\nto satisfy himself, he paid several visits to Mr. Huffaker, in Eastern\\nTennessee and took along his anemometer.', 'He saw quite a number of\\nbuzzards sailing at a height of 75 to 100 feet in breezes measuring 5\\nor 6 miles an hour at the surface of the ground, and once he saw one\\nbuzzard soaring apparently in a dead calm.', 'The writer was fairly baffled.', 'The bird was not simply gliding,\\nutilizing gravity or acquired momentum, he was actually circling\\nhorizontally in defiance of physics and mathematics.', 'It took two years\\nand a whole series of further observations to bring those two sciences\\ninto accord with the facts.', 'Results of Close Observations.', 'Curiously enough the key to the performance of circling in a light wind\\nor a dead calm was not found through the usual way of gathering human\\nknowledge, i. e., through observations and experiment.', 'These had failed\\nbecause I did not know what to look for.', 'The mystery was, in fact,\\nsolved by an eclectic process of conjecture and computation, but once\\nthese computations indicated what observations should be made, the\\nresults gave at once the reasons for the circling of the birds, for\\ntheir then observed attitude, and for the necessity of an independent\\ninitial sustaining speed before soaring began.', 'Both Mr. Huffaker and\\nmyself verified the data many times and I made the computations.', 'These observations disclosed several facts:\\n\\n1st.--That winds blowing five to seventeen miles per hour frequently had\\nrising trends of 10 degrees to 15 degrees, and that upon occasions when\\nthere seemed to be absolutely no wind, there was often nevertheless a\\nlocal rising of the air estimated at a rate of four to eight miles or\\nmore per hour.', 'This was ascertained by watching thistledown, and rising\\nfogs alongside of trees or hills of known height.', 'Everyone will readily\\nrealize that when walking at the rate of four to eight miles an hour in\\na dead calm the \"relative wind\" is quite inappreciable to the senses and\\nthat such a rising air would not be noticed.', '2nd.--That the buzzard, sailing in an apparently dead horizontal calm,\\nprogressed at speeds of fifteen to eighteen miles per hour, as measured\\nby his shadow on the ground.', 'It was thought that the air was then\\npossibly rising 8.8 feet per second, or six miles per hour.', '3rd.--That when soaring in very light winds the angle of incidence of\\nthe buzzards was negative to the horizon--i. e., that when seen coming\\ntoward the eye, the afternoon light shone on the back instead of on the\\nbreast, as would have been the case had the angle been inclined above\\nthe horizon.', '4th.--That the sailing performance only occurred after the bird had\\nacquired an initial velocity of at least fifteen or eighteen miles per\\nhour, either by industrious flapping or by descending from a perch.', 'An Interesting Experiment.', '5th.--That the whole resistance of a stuffed buzzard, at a negative\\nangle of 3 degrees in a current of air of 15.52 miles per hour, was 0.27\\npounds.', 'This test was kindly made for the writer by Professor A. F. Zahm\\nin the \"wind tunnel\" of the Catholic University at Washington, D.

dirigible\\n(steerable) balloon the most ardent advocates of this form of aerial\\nnavigation admit that it has serious drawbacks.', 'Some of these may be\\ndescribed as follows:\\n\\nExpense and Other Items.', 'Great Initial Expense.--The modern dirigible balloon costs a fortune.', 'The Zeppelin, for instance, costs more than $100,000 (these are official\\nfigures).', 'Expense of Inflation.--Gas evaporates rapidly, and a balloon must\\nbe re-inflated, or partially re-inflated, every time it is used.', 'The\\nZeppelin holds 460,000 cubic feet of gas which, even at $1 per thousand,\\nwould cost $460.', 'Difficulty of Obtaining Gas.--If a balloon suddenly becomes deflated, by\\naccident or atmospheric conditions, far from a source of gas supply, it\\nis practically worthless.', 'Gas must be piped to it, or the balloon carted\\nto the gas house--an expensive proceeding in either event.', 'Lack of Speed and Control.', 'Lack of Speed.--Under the most favorable conditions the maximum speed\\nof a balloon is 30 miles an hour.', 'Its great bulk makes the high speed\\nattained by flying machines impossible.', 'Difficulty of Control.--While the modern dirigible balloon is readily\\nhandled in calm or light winds, its bulk makes it difficult to control\\nin heavy winds.', 'The Element of Danger.--Numerous balloons have been destroyed by\\nlightning and similar causes.', 'One of the largest of the Zeppelins was\\nthus lost at Stuttgart in 1908.', 'Some Balloon Performances.', 'It is only a matter of fairness to state that, under favorable\\nconditions, some very creditable records have been made with modern\\nballoons, viz:\\n\\nNovember 23d, 1907, the French dirigible Patrie, travelled 187 miles in\\n6 hours and 45 minutes against a light wind.', 'This was a little over 28\\nmiles an hour.', 'The Clement-Bayard, another French machine, sold to the Russian\\ngovernment, made a trip of 125 miles at a rate of 27 miles an

30 miles an hour.', 'Speed of Flying Machines.', 'Opposed to the balloon performances we have flying machine trips (of\\nauthentic records) as follows:\\n\\nBleriot--monoplane--in 1908--52 miles an hour.', 'Delagrange--June 22, 1908--10 1/2 miles in 16 minutes, approximately 42\\nmiles an hour.', 'Wrights--October, 1905--the machine was then in its infancy--24 miles\\nin 38 minutes,

and gas\\nis expensive.', 'Besides this it is not always possible to obtain it in\\nsufficient quantities even in large cities, as the supply on hand is\\ngenerally needed for regular customers.', 'Such as can be had is either\\nwater or coal gas, neither of which is as efficient in lifting power as\\nhydrogen.', 'Hydrogen is the lightest and consequently the most buoyant of all known\\ngases.', 'It is secured commercially by treating zinc or iron with dilute\\nsulphuric or hydrochloric acid.', 'The average cost may be safely placed\\nat $10 per 1,000 feet so that, to inflate a balloon of the size of the\\nZeppelin, holding 460,000 cubic feet, would cost $4,600.', 'Proportions of Materials Required.', 'In making hydrogen gas it is customary to allow 20 per cent for loss\\nbetween the generation and the introduction of the gas into the balloon.', 'Thus, while the formula calls for iron 28 times heavier than the weight\\nof the hydrogen required, and acid 49 times heavier, the real quantities\\nare 20 per cent greater.', 'Hydrogen weighs about 0.09 ounce to the cubic\\nfoot.', 'Consequently if we need say 450,000 cubic feet of gas we must have\\n2,531.25 pounds in weight.', 'To produce this, allowing for the 20 percent\\nloss, we must have 35 times its weight in iron, or over 44 tons.', 'Of acid\\nit would take 60 times the weight of the gas, or nearly 76 tons.', 'In Time of Emergency.', 'These figures are appalling, and under ordinary conditions would be\\nprohibitive, but there are times when the balloon operator, unable to\\nobtain water or coal gas, must foot the bills.', 'In military maneuvers,\\nwhere the field of operation is fixed, it is possible to furnish\\nsupplies of hydrogen gas in portable cylinders, but on long trips\\nwhere sudden leakage or other cause makes descent in an unexpected spot\\nunavoidable, it becomes a question of making your own hydrogen gas or\\ndeserting the balloon.', 'And when this occurs the balloonist is up against\\nanother serious proposition--can he find the necessary zinc or iron?', 'Can\\nhe get the acid?', 'Balloons for Commercial Use.', 'Despite all this the balloon has its uses.', 'If there is to be such a\\nthing as aerial navigation in a commercial way--the carrying of freight\\nand passengers--it will come through the employment of such monster\\nballoons as Count Zeppelin is building.', 'But even then the carrying\\ncapacity must of necessity be limited.', 'The latest Zeppelin creation,\\na monster in size, is 450 feet long, and 42 1/2 feet in diameter.', 'The\\ndimensions are such as to make all other balloons look like pigmies;\\neven many ocean-going steamers are much smaller, and yet its passenger\\ncapacity is very small.', 'On its 36-hour flight in May, 1909, the\\nZeppelin, carried only eight passengers.', 'The speed, however, was quite\\nrespectable, 850 miles being covered in the 36 hours, a trifle over 23\\nmiles an hour.', 'The reserve buoyancy, that is the total lifting capacity\\naside from the weight of the airship and its equipment, is estimated at\\nthree tons.', 'CHAPTER XXII.', 'PROBLEMS OF AERIAL FLIGHT.', 'In a lecture before the Royal Society of Arts, reported in Engineering,\\nF. W. Lanchester took the position that practical flight was not the\\nabstract question which some apparently considered it to be, but a\\nproblem in locomotive engineering.', 'The flying machine was a locomotive\\nappliance, designed not merely to lift a weight, but to transport it\\nelsewhere, a fact which should be sufficiently obvious.', 'Nevertheless one\\nof the leading scientific men of the day advocated a type in which\\nthis, the main function of the flying machine, was overlooked.', 'When\\nthe machine was considered as a method of transport, the vertical screw\\ntype, or helicopter, became at once ridiculous.', 'It had, nevertheless,\\nmany advocates who had some vague and ill-defined notion of subsequent\\nmotion through the air after the weight was raised.', 'Helicopter Type Useless.', 'When efficiency of transport was demanded, the helicopter type was\\nentirely out of court.', 'Almost all of its advocates neglected the effect\\nof the motion of the machine through the air on the efficiency of the\\nvertical screws.', 'They either assumed that the motion was so slow as not\\nto matter, or that a patch of still air accompanied the machine in its\\nflight.', 'Only one form of this type had any possibility of success.', 'In\\nthis there were two screws running on inclined axles--one on each\\nside of the weight to be lifted.', \"The action of such inclined screw was\\ncurious, and in a previous lecture he had pointed out that it was almost\\nexactly the same as that of a bird's wing.\", 'In high-speed racing craft\\nsuch inclined screws were of necessity often used, but it was at\\na sacrifice of their efficiency.', 'In any case the efficiency of the\\ninclined-screw helicopter could not compare with that of an aeroplane,\\nand that type might be dismissed from consideration so soon as\\nefficiency became the ruling factor of the design.', 'Must Compete With Locomotive.', 'To justify itself the aeroplane must compete, in some regard or other,\\nwith other locomotive appliances, performing one or more of the purposes\\nof locomotion more efficiently than existing systems.', 'It would be no use\\nunless able to stem air currents, so that its velocity must be greater\\nthan that of the worst winds liable to be encountered.', 'To illustrate the\\nlimitations imposed on the motion of an aeroplane by wind velocity, Mr.\\nLanchester gave the diagrams shown in Figs.', '1 to 4.', 'The circle in each\\ncase was, he said, described with a radius equal to the speed of the\\naeroplane in still air, from a center placed \"down-wind\" from the\\naeroplane by an amount equal to the velocity of the wind.', 'Fig.', '1 therefore represented the case in which the air was still, and\\nin this case the aeroplane represented by _A_ had perfect liberty of\\nmovement in any direction\\n\\nIn Fig.', '2 the velocity of the wind was half that of the aeroplane, and\\nthe latter could still navigate in any direction, but its speed against\\nthe wind was only one-third of its speed with the wind.', 'In Fig.', '3 the velocity of the wind was equal to that of the aeroplane,\\nand then motion against the wind was impossible; but it could move to\\nany point of the circle, but not to any point lying to the left of the\\ntangent _A_ _B_.', 'Finally, when the wind had a greater speed than the\\naeroplane, as in Fig.', '4, the machine could move only in directions\\nlimited by the tangents _A_ _C_ and _A_ _D_.', 'Matter of Fuel Consumption.', 'Taking the case in which the wind had a speed equal to half that of the\\naeroplane, Mr. Lanchester said that for a given journey out and home,\\ndown wind and back, the aeroplane would require 30 per cent more fuel\\nthan if the trip were made in still air; while if the journey was made\\nat right angles to the direction of the wind the fuel needed would be 15\\nper cent more than in a calm.', 'This 30 per cent extra was quite a heavy\\nenough addition to the fuel; and to secure even this figure it was\\nnecessary that the aeroplane should have a speed of twice that of the\\nmaximum wind in which it was desired to operate the machine.', 'Again, as\\nstated in the last lecture, to insure the automatic stability of the\\nmachine it was necessary that the aeroplane speed should be largely in\\nexcess of that of the gusts of wind liable to be encountered.', 'Eccentricities of the Wind.', 'There was, Mr. Lanchester said, a loose connection between the average\\nvelocity of the wind and the maximum speed of the gusts.', 'When the\\naverage speed of the wind was 40 miles per hour, that of the gusts might\\nbe equal or more.', 'At one moment there might be a calm or the direction\\nof the wind even reversed, followed, the next moment, by a violent gust.', 'About the same minimum speed was desirable for security against gusts as\\nwas demanded by other considerations.', 'Sixty miles an hour was the least\\nfigure desirable in an aeroplane, and this should be exceeded as much as\\npossible.', \"Actually, the Wright machine had a speed of 38 miles per hour,\\nwhile Farman's Voisin machine flew at 45 miles per hour.\", 'Both machines were extremely sensitive to high winds, and the speaker,\\nin spite of newspaper reports to the contrary, had never seen either\\nflown in more than a gentle breeze.', 'The damping out of the oscillations\\nof the flight path, discussed in the last lecture, increased with the\\nfourth power of the natural velocity of flight, and rapid damping\\nformed the easiest, and sometimes the only, defense against dangerous\\noscillations.', 'A machine just stable at 35 miles per hour would have\\nreasonably rapid damping if its speed were increased to 60 miles per\\nhour.', 'Thinks Use Is Limited.', 'It was, the lecturer proceeded, inconceivable that any very extended use\\nshould be made of the aeroplane unless the speed was much greater than\\nthat of the motor car.', 'It might in special cases be of service,\\napart from this increase of speed, as in the exploration of countries\\ndestitute of roads, but it would have no general utility.', \"With an\\nautomobile averaging 25 to 35 miles per hour, almost any part of Europe,\\nRussia excepted, was attainable in a day's journey.\", 'A flying machine\\nof but equal speed would have no advantages, but if the speed could be\\nraised to 90 or 100 miles per hour, the whole continent of Europe\\nwould become a playground, every part being within a daylight flight of\\nBerlin.', 'Further, some marine craft now had speeds of 40 miles per hour,\\nand efficiently to follow up and report movements of such vessels an\\naeroplane should travel at 60 miles per hour at least.', 'Hence from\\nall points of view appeared the imperative desirability of very high\\nvelocities of flight.', 'The difficulties of achievement were, however,\\ngreat.', 'Weight of Lightest Motors.', 'As shown in the first lecture of his course, the resistance to motion\\nwas nearly independent of the velocity, so that the total work done in\\ntransporting a given weight was nearly constant.', 'Hence the question of\\nfuel economy was not a bar to high velocities of flight, though should\\nthese become excessive, the body resistance might constitute a large\\nproportion of the total.', 'The horsepower required varied as the\\nvelocity, so the factor governing the maximum velocity of flight was\\nthe horsepower that could be developed on a given weight.', 'At present the\\nweight per horsepower of feather-weight motors appeared to range from\\n2 1/4 pounds up to 7 pounds per brake horsepower, some actual figures\\nbeing as follows:\\n\\n         Antoinette........ 5 lbs.', 'Fiat.............. 3 lbs.', 'Gnome.......', 'Under 3 lbs.', 'Metallurgic....... 8 lbs.', 'Renault........... 7 lbs.', 'Wright.............6 lbs.', 'Automobile engines, on the other hand, commonly weighed 12 pounds to 13\\npounds per brake horsepower.', 'For short flights fuel economy was of less importance than a saving\\nin the weight of the engine.', 'For long flights, however, the case\\nwas different.', \"Thus, if the gasolene consumption was 1/2 pound per\\nhorsepower hour, and the engine weighed 3 pounds per brake horsepower,\\nthe fuel needed for a six-hour flight would weigh as much as the engine,\\nbut for half an hour's flight its weight would be unimportant.\", 'Best Means of Propulsion.', 'The best method of propulsion was by the screw, which acting in air\\nwas subject to much the same conditions as obtained in marine work.', 'Its efficiency depended on its diameter and pitch and on its position,\\nwhether in front of or behind the body propelled.', 'From this theory\\nof dynamic support, Mr. Lanchester proceeded, the efficiency of each\\nelement of a screw propeller could be represented by curves such as were\\ngiven in his first lecture before the society, and from these curves the\\nover-all efficiency of any proposed propeller could be computed, by mere\\ninspection, with a fair degree of accuracy.', 'These curves showed that the\\ntips of long-bladed propellers were inefficient, as was also the portion\\nof the blade near the root.', 'In actual marine practice the blade from\\nboss to tip was commonly of such a length that the over-all efficiency\\nwas 95 per cent of that of the most efficient element of it.', 'Advocates Propellers in Rear.', 'From these curves the diameter and appropriate pitch of a screw could\\nbe calculated, and the number of revolutions was then fixed.', 'Thus, for a\\nspeed of 80 feet per second the pitch might come out as 8 feet, in which\\ncase the revolutions would be 600 per minute, which might, however, be\\ntoo low for the motor.', 'It was then necessary either to gear down the\\npropeller, as was done in the Wright machine, or, if it was decided to\\ndrive it direct, to sacrifice some of the efficiency of the propeller.', 'An analogous case arose in the application of the steam turbine to the\\npropulsion of cargo boats, a problem as yet unsolved.', 'The propeller\\nshould always be aft, so that it could abstract energy from the wake\\ncurrent, and also so that its wash was clear of the body propelled.', 'The\\nbest possible efficiency was about 70 per cent, and it was safe to rely\\nupon 66 per cent.', 'Benefits of Soaring Flight.', 'There was, Mr. Lanchester proceeded, some possibility of the aeronaut\\nreducing the power needed for transport by his adopting the principle of\\nsoaring flight, as exemplified by some birds.', 'There were, he continued,\\ntwo different modes of soaring flight.', 'In the one the bird made use of\\nthe upward current of air often to be found in the neighborhood of steep\\nvertical cliffs.', 'These cliffs deflected the air upward long before it\\nactually reached the cliff, a whole region below being thus the seat of\\nan upward current.', 'Darwin has noted that the condor was only to be found\\nin the neighborhood of such cliffs.', 'Along the south coast also the gulls\\nmade frequent use of the up currents due to the nearly perpendicular\\nchalk cliffs along the shore.', 'In the tropics up currents were also caused by temperature differences.', 'Cumulus clouds, moreover, were nearly always the terminations of such\\nup currents of heated air, which, on cooling by expansion in the upper\\nregions, deposited their moisture as fog.', 'These clouds might, perhaps,\\nprove useful in the future in showing the aeronaut where up currents\\nwere to be found.', 'Another mode of soaring flight was that adopted by\\nthe albatross, which took advantage of the fact that the air moved\\nin pulsations, into which the bird fitted itself, being thus able to\\nextract energy from the wind.', 'Whether it would be possible for the\\naeronaut to employ a similar method must be left to the future to\\ndecide.', 'Main Difficulties in Aviation.', 'In practical flight difficulties arose in starting and in alighting.', 'There was a lower limit to the speed at which the machine was stable,\\nand it was inadvisable to leave the ground till this limit was attained.', 'Similarly, in alighting it was inexpedient to reduce the speed below the\\nlimit of stability.', 'This fact constituted a difficulty in the adoption\\nof high speeds, since the length of run needed increased in proportion\\nto the square of the velocity.', 'This drawback could, however, be\\nsurmounted by forming starting and alighting grounds of ample size.', 'He thought it quite likely in the future that such grounds would be\\nconsidered as essential to the flying machine as a seaport was to an\\nocean-going steamer or as a road was to the automobile.', 'Requisites of Flying Machine.', 'Flying machines were commonly divided into monoplanes and biplanes,\\naccording as they had one or two supporting surfaces.', 'The distinction\\nwas not, however, fundamental.', 'To get the requisite strength some\\nform of girder framework was necessary, and it was a mere question of\\nconvenience whether the supporting surface was arranged along both\\nthe top and the bottom of this girder, or along the bottom only.', 'The\\nframework adopted universally was of wood braced by ties of pianoforte\\nwire, an arrangement giving the stiffness desired with the least\\npossible weight.', 'Some kind of chassis was also necessary.', 'CHAPTER XXIII.', 'AMATEURS MAY USE WRIGHT PATENTS.', 'Owing to the fact that the Wright brothers have enjoined a number of\\nprofessional aviators from using their system of control, amateurs have\\nbeen slow to adopt it.', 'They recognize its merits, and would like to use\\nthe system, but have been apprehensive that it might involve them in\\nlitigation.', 'There is no danger of this, as will be seen by the following\\nstatement made by the Wrights:\\n\\nWhat Wright Brothers Say.', '\"Any amateur, any professional who is not exhibiting for money, is at\\nliberty to use our patented devices.', 'We shall be glad to have them do\\nso, and there will be no interference on our part, by legal action, or\\notherwise.', 'The only men we proceed against are those who, without our\\npermission, without even asking our consent, coolly appropriate the\\nresults of our labors and use them for the purpose of making money.', 'Curtiss, Delagrange, Voisin, and all the rest of them who have used our\\ndevices have done so in money-making exhibitions.', 'So long as there\\nis any money to be made by the use of the products of our brains, we\\npropose to have it ourselves.', 'It is the only way in which we can get\\nany return for the years of patient work we have given to the problem of\\naviation.', 'On the other hand, any man who wants to use these devices for\\nthe purpose of pleasure, or the advancement of science, is welcome to do\\nso, without money and without price.', 'This is fair enough, is it not?\"', 'Basis of the Wright Patents.', 'In a flying machine a normally flat aeroplane having lateral marginal\\nportions capable of movement to different positions above or below the\\nnormal plane of the body of the aeroplane, such movement being about\\nan axis transverse to the line of flight, whereby said lateral marginal\\nportions may be moved to different angles relatively to the normal\\nplane of the body of the aeroplane, so as to present to the atmosphere\\ndifferent angles of incidence, and means for so moving said lateral\\nmarginal portions, substantially as described.', 'Application of vertical struts near the ends having flexible joints.', 'Means for simultaneously imparting such movement to said lateral\\nportions to different angles relatively to each other.', 'Refers to the movement of the lateral portions on the same side to the\\nsame angle.', 'Means for simultaneously moving vertical rudder so as to present to\\nthe wind that side thereof nearest the side of the aeroplane having the\\nsmallest angle of incidence.', 'Lateral stability is obtained by warping the end wings by moving the\\nlever at the right hand of the operator, connection being made by wires\\nfrom the lever to the wing tips.', 'The rudder may also be curved or warped\\nin similar manner by lever action.', 'Wrights Obtain an Injunction.', 'In January, 1910, Judge Hazel, of the United States Circuit Court,\\ngranted a preliminary injunction restraining the Herring-Curtiss\\nCo., and Glenn H. Curtiss, from manufacturing, selling, or using for\\nexhibition purposes the machine known as the Curtiss aeroplane.', 'The\\ninjunction was obtained on the ground that the Curtiss machine is an\\ninfringement upon the Wright patents in the matter of wing warping and\\nrudder control.', 'It is not the purpose of the authors to discuss the subject pro or con.', 'Such discussion would have no proper place in a volume of this kind.', 'It\\nis enough to say that Curtiss stoutly insists that his machine is not\\nan infringement of the Wright patents, although Judge Hazel evidently\\nthinks differently.', 'What the Judge Said.', 'In granting the preliminary injunction the judge said:\\n\\n\"Defendants claim generally that the difference in construction of their\\napparatus causes the equilibrium or lateral balance to be maintained and\\nits aerial movement secured upon an entirely different principle from\\nthat of complainant; the defendants\\' aeroplanes are curved, firmly\\nattached to the stanchions and hence are incapable of twisting or\\nturning in any direction; that the supplementary planes or so-called\\nrudders are secured to the forward stanchion at the extreme lateral ends\\nof the planes and are adjusted midway between the upper and lower\\nplanes with the margins extending beyond the edges; that in moving the\\nsupplementary planes equal and uniform angles of incidence are presented\\nas distinguished from fluctuating angles of incidence.', 'Such claimed\\nfunctional effects, however, are strongly contradicted by the expert\\nwitness for complainant.', 'Similar to Plan of Wrights.', '\"Upon this contention it is sufficient to say that the affidavits for\\nthe complainant so clearly define the principle of operation of the\\nflying machines in question that I am reasonably satisfied that there\\nis a variableness of the angle of incidence in the machine of defendants\\nwhich is produced when a supplementary plane on one side is tilted\\nor raised and the other stimultaneously tilted or lowered.', 'I am also\\nsatisfied that the rear rudder is turned by the operator to the side\\nhaving the least angle of incidence and that such turning is done at the\\ntime the supplementary planes are raised or depressed to prevent tilting\\nor upsetting the machine.', \"On the papers presented I incline to the view,\\nas already indicated, that the claims of the patent in suit should be\\nbroadly construed; and when given such construction, the elements of\\nthe Wright machine are found in defendants' machine performing the\\nsame functional result.\", \"There are dissimilarities in the defendants'\\nstructure--changes of form and strengthening of parts--which may be\\nimprovements, but such dissimilarities seem to me to have no bearing\\nupon the means adopted to preserve the equilibrium, which means are the\\nequivalent of the claims in suit and attain an identical result.\", 'Variance From Patent Immaterial.', '\"Defendants further contend that the curved or arched surfaces of the\\nWright aeroplanes in commercial use are departures from the patent,\\nwhich describes \\'substantially flat surfaces,\\' and that such a\\nconstruction would be wholly impracticable.', 'The drawing, Fig.', '3,\\nhowever, attached to the specification, shows a curved line inward of\\nthe aeroplane with straight lateral edges, and considering such drawing\\nwith the terminology of the specification, the slight arching of the\\nsurface is not thought a material departure; at any rate, the patent in\\nissue does not belong to the class of patents which requires narrowing\\nto the details of construction.\"', '\"June Bug\" First Infringement.', 'Referring to the matter of priority, the judge said:\\n\\n\"Indeed, no one interfered with the rights of the patentees by\\nconstructing machines similar to theirs until in July, 1908, when\\nCurtiss exhibited a flying machine which he called the \\'June Bug.\\'', 'He\\nwas immediately notified by the patentees that such machine with its\\nmovable surfaces at the tips of wings infringed the patent in suit, and\\nhe replied that he did not intend to publicly exhibit the machine for\\nprofit, but merely was engaged in exhibiting it for scientific purposes\\nas a member of the Aerial Experiment Association.', 'To this the patentees\\ndid not object.', 'Subsequently, however, the machine, with supplementary\\nplanes placed midway between the upper and lower aeroplanes, was\\npublicly exhibited by the defendant corporation and used by Curtiss in\\naerial flights for prizes and emoluments.', 'It further appears that the\\ndefendants now threaten to continue such use for gain and profit, and to\\nengage in the manufacture and sale of such infringing machines, thereby\\nbecoming an active rival of complainant in the business of constructing\\nflying machines embodying the claims in suit, but such use of the\\ninfringing machines it is the duty of this court, on the papers\\npresented, to enjoin.', '\"The requirements in patent causes for the issuance of an injunction\\npendente lite--the validity of the patent, general acquiescence by the\\npublic and infringement by the defendants--are so reasonably clear that\\nI believe if not probable the complainant may succeed at final hearing,\\nand therefore, status quo should be preserved and a preliminary\\ninjunction granted.', '\"So ordered.\"', 'Points Claimed By Curtiss.', 'That the Herring-Curtiss Co. will appeal is a certainty.', 'Mr. Emerson R.\\nNewell, counsel for the company, states its case as follows:\\n\\n\"The Curtiss machine has two main supporting surfaces, both of which are\\ncurved * * * and are absolutely rigid at all times and cannot be moved,\\nwarped or distorted in any manner.', 'The front horizontal rudder is used\\nfor the steering up or down, and the rear vertical rudder is used only\\nfor steering to the right or left, in the same manner as a boat is\\nsteered by its rudder.', \"The machine is provided at the rear with a fixed\\nhorizontal surface, which is not present in the machine of the patent,\\nand which has a distinct advantage in the operation of defendants'\\nmachine, as will be hereafter discussed.\", 'Does Not Warp Main Surface.', '\"Defendants\\' machine does not use the warping of the main supporting\\nsurfaces in restoring the lateral equilibrium, but has two comparatively\\nsmall pivoted balancing surfaces or rudders.', 'When one end of the machine\\nis tipped up or down from the normal, these planes may be thrown in\\nopposite directions by the operator, and so steer each end of the\\nmachine up or down to its normal level, at which time tension upon them\\nis released and they are moved back by the pressure of the wind to their\\nnormal position.', 'Rudder Used Only For Steering.', '\"When defendants\\' balancing surfaces are moved they present equal angles\\nof incidence to the normal rush of air and equal resistances, at each\\nside of the machine, and there is therefore no tendency to turn around a\\nvertical axis as is the case of the machine of the patent, consequently\\nno reason or necessity for turning the vertical rear rudder in\\ndefendants\\' machine to counteract any such turning tendency.', 'At any\\nrate, whatever may be the theories in regard to this matter, the fact is\\nthat the operator of defendants\\' machine does not at any time turn his\\nvertical rudder to counteract any turning tendency clue to the side\\nbalancing surfaces, but only uses it to steer the machine the same as a\\nboat is steered.\"', 'Aero Club Recognizes Wrights.', 'The Aero Club of America has officially recognized the Wright patents.', \"This course was taken following a conference held April 9th, 1910,\\nparticipated in by William Wright and Andrew Freedman, representing the\\nWright Co., and the Aero Club's committee, of Philip T.

W. Jamieson says in Aeronautics:\\n\\n\"Take for example an 8-foot screw propeller having an 8-foot pitch at\\nits largest diameter.', 'If the angle is the same throughout its entire\\nblade length, then all the porions of its blades approaching the hub\\nfrom its outer portion would have a gradually decreasing pitch.', 'The\\n2-foot portion would have a 2-foot pitch; the 3-foot portion a 3-foot\\npitch, and so on to the 8-foot portion which would have an 8-foot pitch.', 'When this form of propeller is caused to revolve, say 500 r.p.m., the\\n8-foot portion would have a calculated pitch speed of 8 feet by 500\\nrevolutions, or 4,000 feet per min.', '; while the 2-foot portion would have\\na calculated pitch speed of 500 revolutions by 2 feet, or 1,000 feet per\\nminute.', 'Effect of Non-Uniformity.', '\"Now, as all of the portions of this type of screw propeller must travel\\nat some pitch speed, which must have for its maximum a pitch speed\\nin feet below the calculated pitch speed of the largest diameter, it\\nfollows that some portions of its blades would perform useful work\\nwhile the action of the other portions would be negative--resisting\\nthe forward motion of the portions having a greater pitch speed.', 'The\\nportions having a pitch speed below that at which the screw is traveling\\ncease to perform useful work after their pitch speed has been exceeded\\nby the portions having a larger diameter and a greater pitch speed.', '\"We might compare the larger and smaller diameter portions of this form\\nof screw propeller, to two power-driven vessels connected with a line,\\none capable of traveling 20 miles per hour, the other 10 miles per hour.', 'It can be readily understood that the boat capable of traveling 10 miles\\nper hour would have no useful effect to help the one traveling 20 miles\\nper hour, as its action would be such as to impose a dead load upon the\\nlatter\\'s progress.\"', 'The term \"slip,\" as applied to a screw propeller, is the distance\\nbetween its calculated pitch speed and the actual distance it travels\\nthrough under load, depending upon the efficiency and proportion of its\\nblades and the amount of load it has to carry.', 'The action of a screw propeller while performing useful work might be\\ncompared to a nut traveling on a threaded bolt; little resistance is\\noffered to its forward motion while it spins freely without load, but\\ngive it a load to carry; then it will take more power to keep up its\\nspeed; if too great a load is applied the thread will strip, and so\\nit is with a screw propeller gliding spirally on the air.', 'A propeller\\ntraveling without load on to new air might be compared to the nut\\ntraveling freely on the bolt.', 'It would consume but little power and it\\nwould travel at nearly its calculated pitch speed, but give it work to\\ndo and then it will take power to drive it.', 'There is a reaction caused from the propeller projecting air backward\\nwhen it slips, which, together with the supporting effect of the blades,\\ncombine to produce useful work or pull on the object to be carried.', 'A screw propeller working under load approaches more closely to its\\nmaximum efficiency as it carries its load with a minimum amount of slip,\\nor nearing its calculated pitch speed.', 'Why Blades Are Curved.', 'It has been pointed out by experiment that certain forms of curved\\nsurfaces as applied to aeroplanes will lift more per horse power, per\\nunit of square foot, while on the other hand it has been shown that a\\nflat surface will lift more per horse power, but requires more area of\\nsurface to do it.', 'As a true pitch screw propeller is virtually a rotating aeroplane, a\\ncurved surface may be advantageously employed when the limit of size\\nprevents using large plane surfaces for the blades.', 'Care should be exercised in keeping the chord of any curve to be used\\nfor the blades at the proper pitch angle, and in all cases propeller\\nblades should be made rigid so as to preserve the true angle and not be\\ndistorted by centrifugal force or from any other cause, as flexibility\\nwill seriously affect their pitch speed and otherwise affect their\\nefficiency.', 'How to Determine Angle.', 'To find the angle for the proper pitch at any point in the diameter of\\na propeller, determine the circumference by multiplying the diameter by\\n3.1416, which represent by drawing a line to scale in feet.', 'At the end\\nof this line draw another line to represent the desired pitch in feet.', 'Then draw a line from the point representing the desired pitch in feet\\nto the beginning of the circumference line.', 'For example:\\n\\nIf the propeller to be laid out is 7 feet in diameter, and is to have\\na 7-foot pitch, the circumference will be 21.99 feet.', 'Draw a diagram\\nrepresenting the circumference line and pitch in feet.', 'If this diagram\\nis wrapped around a cylinder the angle line will represent a true thread\\n7 feet in diameter and 7 feet long, and the angle of the thread will be\\n17 3/4 degrees.', 'Relation of Diameter to Circumference.', 'Since the areas of circles decrease as the diameter lessens, it follows\\nthat if a propeller is to travel at a uniform pitch speed, the volume of\\nits blade displacement should decrease as its diameter becomes less, so\\nas to occupy a corresponding relation to the circumferences of larger\\ndiameters, and at the same time the projected area of the blade must be\\nparallel along its full length and should represent a true sector of a\\ncircle.', 'Let us suppose a 7-foot circle to be divided into 20 sectors, one of\\nwhich represents a propeller blade.', 'If the pitch is to be 7 feet, then\\nthe greatest depth of the angle would be 1/20 part of the pitch, or 4\\n2/10 inch.', 'If the line representing the greatest depth of the angle is\\nkept the same width as it approaches the hub, the pitch will be uniform.', 'If the blade is set at an angle so its projected area is 1/20 part of\\nthe pitch, and if it is moved through 20 divisions for one revolution,\\nit would have a travel of 7 feet.', 'CHAPTER XXV.', 'NEW MOTORS AND DEVICES.', 'Since the first edition of this book was printed, early in 1910, there\\nhas been a remarkable advance in the construction of aeroplane motors,\\nwhich has resulted in a wonderful decrease in the amount of surface area\\nfrom that formerly required.', 'Marked gain in lightness and speed of\\nthe motor has enabled aviators to get along, in some instances, with\\none-quarter of the plane supporting area previously used.', 'The first\\nWright biplane, propelled by a motor of 25 h.p., productive of a fair\\naverage speed of 30 miles an hour, had a plane surface of 538 square\\nfeet.', 'Now, by using a specially designed motor of 65 h. p., capable\\nof developing a speed of from 70 to 80 miles an hour, the Wrights are\\nenabled to successfully navigate a machine the plane area of which is\\nabout 130 square feet.', 'This apparatus is intended to carry only one\\nperson (the operator).', 'At Belmont Park, N.

\"No.', '20\\nBaby.\"', 'It is of 18 feet spread, and 20 feet over all in depth.', 'It stands\\n4 feet 2 inches in height, not counting the propeller.', 'When this latter\\nis in a vertical position the extreme height of the machine is 7 feet\\n5 inches.', 'It is strictly a one-man apparatus.', 'The total surface area\\nis 115 square feet.', 'The total weight of the monoplane with engine and\\npropeller is 352 pounds.', 'Santos-Dumont weighs 110 pounds, so the entire\\nweight carried while in flight is 462 pounds, or about 3.6 pounds per\\nsquare foot of surface.', 'Bamboo is used in the construction of the body frame, and also for the\\nframe of the tail.', 'The body frame consists of three bamboo poles about\\n2 inches in diameter at the forward end and tapering to about 1 inch at\\nthe rear.', 'These poles are jointed with brass sockets near the rear of\\nthe main plane so they may be taken apart easily for convenience in\\nhousing or transportation.', 'The main plane is built upon four transverse\\nspars of ash, set at a slight dihedral angle, two being placed on each\\nside of the central bamboo.', 'These spars are about 2 inches wide by 1\\n1/8-inch deep for a few feet each side of the center of the machine, and\\nfrom there taper down to an inch in depth at the center bamboo, and at\\ntheir outer ends, but the width remains the same throughout their entire\\nlength.', 'The planes are double surfaced with silk and laced above and\\nbelow the bamboo ribs which run fore and aft under the main spars and\\nterminate in a forked clip through which a wire is strung for lacing on\\nthe silk.', 'The tail consists of a horizontal and vertical surface placed\\non a universal joint about 10 feet back of the rear edge of the main\\nplane.', 'Both of these surfaces are flat and consist of a silk covering\\nstretched upon bamboo ribs.', 'The horizontal surface is 6 feet 5 inches\\nacross, and 4 feet 9 inches from front to back.', 'The vertical surface\\nis of the same width (6 feet 5 inches) but is only 3 feet 7 inches\\nfrom front to back.', 'All the details of construction are shown in the\\naccompanying illustration.', 'Power is furnished by a very light (110 pounds) Darracq motor, of the\\ndouble-opposed-cylinder type.', 'It has a bore of 4.118 inches, and stroke\\nof 4.724 inches, runs at 1,800 r. p. m., and with a 6 1/2-foot propeller\\ndevelops a thrust of 242 1/2 pounds when the monoplane is held steady.', 'Bleriot--No.', 'XI, the latest of the Bleriot productions, and the greatest\\nrecord maker of the lot, is 28 feet in spread of main plane, and depth\\nof 6 feet in largest part.', 'This would give a main surface of 168 square\\nfeet, but as the ends of the plane are sharply tapered from the rear,\\nthe actual surface is reduced to 150 square feet.', 'Projecting from\\nthe main frame is an elongated tail (shown in the illustration) which\\ncarries the horizontal and vertical rudders.', 'The former is made in three\\nsections.', 'The center piece is 6 feet 1 inch in spread, and 2 feet 10\\ninches in depth, containing 17 square feet of surface.', 'The end sections,\\nwhich are made movable for warping purposes, are each 2 feet 10 inches\\nsquare, the combined surface area in the entire horizontal rudder\\nbeing 33 square feet.', 'The vertical rudder contains 4 1/2 square feet of\\nsurface, making the entire supporting area 187 1/2 square feet.', 'From the outer end of the propeller shaft in front to the extreme rear\\nedge of the vertical rudder, the machine is 25 feet deep.', 'Deducting\\nthe 6-foot depth of the main plane leaves 19 feet as the length of the\\nrudder beam and rudders.', 'The motor equipment consists of a 3-cylinder,\\nair-cooled engine of about 30 h. p. placed at the front end of the body\\nframe, and carrying on its crankshaft a two-bladed propeller 6 feet 8\\ninches in diameter.', 'The engine speed is about 1,250 r. p. m. at which\\nthe propeller develops a thrust of over 200 pounds.', 'The Bleriot XI complete weighs 484 pounds, and with operator and fuel\\nsupply ready for a 25- or 30-mile flight, 715 pounds.', 'One peculiarity of\\nthe Bleriot construction is that, while the ribs of the main plane are\\ncurved, there is no preliminary bending of the pieces as in other forms\\nof construction.', 'Bleriot has his rib pieces cut a little longer than\\nrequired and, by springing them into place, secures the necessary\\ncurvature.', 'A good view of the Bleriot plane framework is given on page\\n63.', 'Combined Triplane and Biplane.', 'At Norwich, Conn., the Stebbins-Geynet Co., after several years of\\nexperiment, has begun the manufacture of a combination triplane and\\nbiplane machine.', 'The center plane, which is located about midway\\nbetween the upper and lower surfaces, is made removable.', 'The change\\nfrom triplane to biplane, or vice versa, may be readily made in a few\\nminutes.', 'The constructors claim for this type of air craft a large\\nsupporting surface area with the minimum of dimensions in planes.', 'Although this machine has only 24-foot spread and is only 26 feet over\\nall, its total amount of supporting area is 400 square feet; weight, 600\\npounds in flying order, and lifting capacity approximately 700 pounds\\nmore.', 'The frame is made entirely of a selected grade of Oregon spruce,\\nfinished down to a smooth surface and varnished.', 'All struts are\\nfish-shaped and set in aluminum sockets, which are bolted to top and\\nlower beams with special strong bolts of small diameter.', 'The middle\\nplane is set inside the six uprights and held in place by aluminum\\ncastings.', 'A flexible twisted seven-strand wire cable and Stebbins-Geynet\\nturnbuckles are used for trussing.', 'The top plane is in three sections, laced together.', 'It has a 24-foot\\nspread and is 7 feet in depth.', 'The middle plane is in two sections each\\nof 7 1/2 feet spread and 6 feet in depth.', 'The center ends of the middle\\nplane sections do not come within 5 feet of joining, this open space\\nbeing left for the engine.', 'The bottom plane is of 16 feet spread and 5\\nfeet in depth.', 'It will thus be seen that the planes overhang one another\\nin depth, the bottom one being the smallest in this respect.', 'The planes\\nare set at an angle of 9 degrees, and there is a clear space of 3 1/2\\nfeet between each, making the total distance from the bottom to the top\\nplane a trifle over 7 feet.', 'The total supporting surface in the main\\nplanes is 350 square feet.', 'By arranging the three plane surfaces at\\nan angle as described and varying their size, the greatest amount of\\nlifting area is secured above the center of gravity, and the greatest\\nweight carried below.', 'The ribs are made of laminated spruce, finished down to 1/2x3/4-inch\\ncross section dimensions, with a curvature of about 1 in 20, and\\nfastened to the beams with special aluminum castings.', 'Number 2 Naiad\\naeroplane cloth is used in covering the planes, with pockets sewn in for\\nthe ribs.', 'Two combination elevating rudders are set up well in front, each having\\n18 square feet of supporting area.', 'These rudders are arranged to work\\nin unison, independently, or in opposite directions.', 'In the Model B\\nmachine, there are also two small rear elevating rudders, which work in\\nunison with the front rudders.', 'One vertical rudder of 10 square feet is\\nsuspended in the rear of a small stationary horizontal plane in Model A,\\nwhile the vertical rudder on Model B is only 6 square feet in size.', 'The\\nelevating rudders are arranged so as to act as stabilizing planes when\\nthe machine is in flight.', 'The wing tips are held in place with a special\\ntwo-piece casting which forms a hinge, and makes a quick detachable\\njoint.', 'Wing tips are also used in balancing.', 'Model A is equipped with a Cameron 25-30 h. p., 4-cylinder, air-cooled\\nmotor.', 'On Model B a Holmes rotary 7-cylinder motor of 4x4-inch bore and\\nstroke is used.', 'Positive control is secured by use of the Stebbins-Geynet \"auto-control\"\\nsystem.', 'A pull or push movement operates the elevating rudders, while\\nthe balancing is done by means of side movements or slight turns.', 'The\\nrear vertical rudder is manipulated by means of a foot lever.', 'New Cody Biplane.', 'Among the comparatively new biplanes is one constructed by Willard F.\\nCody, of London, Eng., the principal distinctive feature of which is an\\nautomatic control which works independently of the hand levers.', 'For the\\nother control a long lever carrying a steering wheel furnishes all the\\nnecessary control movements, there being no footwork at all.', 'The lever\\nis universally jointed and when moved fore and aft operates the two\\nailerons as if they were one; when the shaft is rotated it moves the\\ntail as a whole.', 'The horizontal tail component is immovable.', 'When the\\nlever is moved from side to side it works not only the ailerons and\\nthe independent elevators, but also through a peculiar arrangement, the\\nvertical rear rudder as well.', 'The spread of the planes is 46 feet 6 inches and the width 6 feet 6\\ninches.', 'The ailerons jut out 1 foot 6 inches on each side of the machine\\nand are 13 feet 6 inches long.', 'The cross-shaped tail is supported by an\\noutrigger composed of two long bamboos and of this the vertical plane\\nis 9 feet by 4 feet, while the horizontal plane is 8 feet by 4 feet.', 'The\\nover-all length of the machine is 36 feet.', 'The lifting surface is 857\\nsquare feet.', 'It will weigh, with a pilot, 1,450 pounds.', 'The distance\\nbetween the main planes is 8 feet 6 inches, which is a rather notable\\nfeature in this flyer.', 'The propeller has a diameter of 11 feet and 2 inches with a 13-foot\\n6-inch pitch; it is driven at 560 revolutions by a chain, and the gear\\nreduction between the chain and propeller shaft is two to one.', 'The machine from elevator to tail plane bristles in original points.', 'The\\nhump in the ribs has been cut away entirely, so that although the plane\\nis double surfaced, the surfaces are closest together at a point which\\napproximates the center of pressure.', 'The plane is practically of two\\nstream-line forms, of which one is the continuation of the other.', 'This construction, claims the inventor, will give increased lift, and\\ndecreased head resistance.', 'The trials substantiate this, as the angle of\\nincidence in flying is only about one in twenty-six.', 'The ribs in the main planes are made of strips of silver spruce one-half\\nby one-half inch, while those in the ailerons are solid and one-fourth\\ninch thick.', 'In the main planes the fabric is held down with thin wooden\\nfillets.', \"Cody's planes are noted for their neatness, rigidity and\\nsmoothness.\", 'Pegamoid fabric is used throughout.', 'Pressey Automatic

 A pendulum is made up of a bob attached to an inextensible string fixed at one end . The bob weighs 2 kilograms . The string is 1.5 meters long . Gravity causes the pendulum to swing . The motion is periodic and can be approximated by simple harmonic motion for small angles . The pendulum 's period depends on period length and gravity . The mass of the bob does not affect the period .

IN MEMORIAM.
Octave Chanute, "the father of the modern flying machine," died at his
      home in Chicago on November 23, 1910, at the age of 72 years. His last
      work in the interest of aviation was to furnish the introductory chapter
      to the first edition of this volume, and to render valuable assistance in
      the handling of the various subjects. He even made the trip from his home
      to the office of the publishers one inclement day last spring, to look
      over the proofs of the book and, at his suggestion, several important
      changes were made. All this was "a labor of love" on Mr. Chanute's part.
      He gave of his time and talents freely because he was enthusiastic in the
      cause of aviation, and because he knew the authors of this book and
      desired to give them material aid in the preparation of the workâ€”a
      favor that was most sincerely appreciated.
The authors desire to make acknowledgment of many courtesies in the way of
      valuable advice, information, etc., extended by Mr. Octave Chanute, C. E.,
      Mr. E. L. Jones, Editor of Aeronautics, and the publishers of, the New
      England Automobile Journal and Fly.

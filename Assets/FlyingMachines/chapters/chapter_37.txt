CHAPTER XXV. NEW MOTORS AND DEVICES.
Since the first edition of this book was printed, early in 1910, there has
      been a remarkable advance in the construction of aeroplane motors, which
      has resulted in a wonderful decrease in the amount of surface area from
      that formerly required. Marked gain in lightness and speed of the motor
      has enabled aviators to get along, in some instances, with one-quarter of
      the plane supporting area previously used. The first Wright biplane,
      propelled by a motor of 25 h.p., productive of a fair average speed of 30
      miles an hour, had a plane surface of 538 square feet. Now, by using a
      specially designed motor of 65 h. p., capable of developing a speed of
      from 70 to 80 miles an hour, the Wrights are enabled to successfully
      navigate a machine the plane area of which is about 130 square feet. This
      apparatus is intended to carry only one person (the operator). At Belmont
      Park, N. Y., the Wrights demonstrated that the small-surfaced biplane is
      much faster, easier to manage in the hands of a skilled manipulator, and a
      better altitude climber than the large and cumbersome machines with 538
      square feet of surface heretofore used by them.
In this may be found a practical illustration of the principle that
      increased speed permits of a reduction in plane area in mathematical ratio
      to the gain in speed. The faster any object can be made to move through
      the air, the less will be the supporting surface required to sustain a
      given weight. But, there is a limit beyond which the plane surface cannot
      be reduced with safety. Regard must always be had to the securing of an
      ample sustaining surface so that in case of motor stoppage there will be
      sufficient buoyancy to enable the operator to descend safely.
The baby Wright used at the Belmont Park (N. Y.) aviation meet in the fall
      of 1910, had a plane length of 19 feet 6 inches, and an extreme breadth of
      21 feet 6 inches, with a total surface area of 146 square feet. It was
      equipped with a new Wright 8-cylinder motor of 60 h. p., and two Wright
      propellers of 8 feet 6 inches diameter and 500 r. p. m. It was easily the
      fastest machine at the meet. After the tests, Wilbur Wright said:
"It is our intention to put together a machine with specially designed
      propellers, specially designed gears and a motor which will give us 65
      horsepower at least. We will then be able, after some experimental work we
      are doing now, to send forth a machine that will make a new speed record."
In the new Wright machines the front elevating planes for up-and-down
      control have been eliminated, and the movements of the apparatus are now
      regulated solely by the rear, or "tail" control.
A Powerful Light Motor.
Another successful American aviation motor is the aeromotor, manufactured
      by the Detroit Aeronautic Construction. Aeromotors are made in four models
      as follows:
Model 1.—4-cylinder, 30-40 h. p., weight 200 pounds.
Model 2.—4-cylinder, (larger stroke and bore) 40-50 h. p., weight
      225 pounds.
Model 3.—6-cylinder. 50-60 h. p., weight 210 pounds.
Model 4.—6-cylinder, 60-75 h. p., weight 275 pounds.
This motor is of the 4-cycle, vertical, water-cooled type. Roberts
      Aviation Motor.
One of the successful aviation motors of American make, is that produced
      by the Roberts Motor Co., of Sandusky, Ohio. It is designed by E. W.
      Roberts, M. E., who was formerly chief assistant and designer for Sir
      Hiram Maxim, when the latter was making his celebrated aeronautical
      experiments in England in 1894-95. This motor is made in both the 4- and
      6-cylinder forms. The 4-cylinder motor weighs complete with Bosch magneto
      and carbureter 165 pounds, and will develop 40 actual brake h. p. at 1,000
      r. p. m., 46 h. p. at 1,200 and 52 h. p. at 1,400. The 6-cylinder weighs
      220 pounds and will develop 60 actual brake h. p. at 1,000 r. p. m., 69 h.
      p. at 1,200 and 78 h. p. at 1,500.
Extreme lightness has been secured by doing away with all superfluous
      parts, rather than by a shaving down of materials to a dangerous thinness.
      For example, there is neither an intake or exhaust manifold on the motor.
      The distributing valve forms a part of the crankcase as does the water
      intake, and the gear pump. Magnalium takes the place of aluminum in the
      crankcase, because it is not only lighter but stronger and can be cast
      very thin. The crankshaft is 2 1/2-inch diameter with a 2 1/4-inch hole,
      and while it would be strong enough in ordinary 40 per cent carbon steel
      it is made of steel twice the strength of that customarily employed.
      Similar care has been exercised on other parts and the result is a motor
      weighing 4 pounds per h. p.
The Rinek Motor.
The Rinek aviation motor, constructed by the Rinek Aero Mfg. Co., of
      Easton, Pa., is another that is meeting with favor among aviators. Type
      B-8 is an 8-cylinder motor, the cylinders being set at right angles, on a
      V-shaped crank case. It is water cooled, develops 50-60 h. p., the minimum
      at 1,220 r. p. m., and weighs 280 pounds with all accessories. Type B-4, a
      4-cylinder motor, develops 30 h. p. at 1,800 r. p. m., and weighs 130
      pounds complete. The cylinders in both motors are made of cast iron with
      copper water jackets.
The Overhead Camshaft Boulevard.
The overhead camshaft Boulevard is still another form of aviation motor
      which has been favorably received. This is the product of the Boulevard
      Engine Co., of St. Louis. It is made with 4 and 8 cylinders. The former
      develops 30-35 h. p. at 1,200 r. p. m., and weighs 130 pounds. The
      8-cylinder motor gives 60-70 h. p. at 1,200 r. p. m., and weighs 200
      pounds. Simplicity of construction is the main feature of this motor,
      especially in the manipulation of the valves.

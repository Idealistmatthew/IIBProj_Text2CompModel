CHAPTER XXVI. MONOPLANES, TRIPLANES, MULTIPLANES.
Until recently, American aviators had not given serious attention to any
      form of flying machines aside from biplanes. Of the twenty-one monoplanes
      competing at the International meet at Belmont Park, N. Y., in November,
      1910, only three makes were handled by Americans. Moissant and Drexel
      navigated Bleriot machines, Harkness an Antoinette, and Glenn Curtiss a
      single decker of his own construction. On the other hand the various
      foreign aviators who took part in the meet unhesitatingly gave preference
      to monoplanes.
Whatever may have been the cause of this seeming prejudice against the
      monoplane on the part of American air sailors, it is slowly being
      overcome. When a man like Curtiss, who has attained great success with
      biplanes, gives serious attention to the monoplane form of construction
      and goes so far as to build and successfully operate a single surface
      machine, it may be taken for granted that the monoplane is a fixture in
      this country.
Dimensions of Monoplanes.
The makes, dimensions and equipment of the various monoplanes used at
      Belmont Park are as follows:
Bleriot—(Moissant, operator)—plane length 23 feet, extreme
      breadth 28 feet, surface area 160 square feet, 7-cylinder, 50 h. p. Gnome
      engine, Chauviere propeller, 7 feet 6 inches diameter, 1,200 r. p. m.
Bleriot—(Drexel, operator)—exactly the same as Moissant's
      machine.
Antoinette—(Harkness, operator)—plane length 42 feet, extreme
      breadth 46 feet, surface area 377 square feet, Emerson 6-cylinder, 50 h.
      p. motor, Antoinette propeller, 7 feet 6 inches diameter, 1,200 r. p. m.
Curtiss—(Glenn H. Curtiss, operator)—plane length 25 feet,
      extreme breadth 26 feet, surface area 130 square feet, Curtiss 8-cylinder,
      60 h. p. motor, Paragon propeller, 7 feet in diameter, 1,200 r. p. m.
With one exception Curtiss had the smallest machine of any of those
      entering into competition. The smallest was La Demoiselle, made by
      Santos-Dumont, the proportions of which were: plane length 20 feet,
      extreme breadth 18 feet, surface area 100 square feet, Clement-Bayard
      2-cylinder, 30 h. p. motor, Chauviere propeller, 6 feet 6 inches in
      diameter, 1,100 r. p. m.
Winnings Made with Monoplanes.
Operators of monoplanes won a fair share of the cash prizes. They won
      $30,283 out of a total of $63,250, to say nothing about Grahame-White's
      winnings. The latter won $13,600, but part of his winning flights were
      made in a Bleriot monoplane, and part in a Farman machine. Aside from
      Grahame-White the winnings were divided as follows: Moissant (Bleriot)
      $13,350; Latham (Antoinette) $8,183; Aubrun (Bleriot) $2,400; De Lesseps
      (Bleriot) $2,300; Drexel (Bleriot) $1,700; Radley (Bleriot) $1,300; Simon
      (Bleriot) $750; Andemars (Clement-Bayard) $100; Barrier (Bleriot) $100.
Out of a total of $30,283, operators of Bleriot machines won $21,900,
      again omitting Grahame-White's share. If the winnings with monoplane and
      biplane could be divided so as to show the amount won with each type of
      machine the credit side of the Bleriot account would be materially
      enlarged.
The Most Popular Monoplanes.
While the number of successful monoplanes is increasing rapidly, and there
      is some feature of advantage in nearly all the new makes, interest centers
      chiefly in the Santos-Dumont, Antoinette and Bleriot machines. This is
      because more has been accomplished with them than with any of the others,
      possibly because they have had greater opportunities.
For the guidance of those who may wish to build a machine of the monoplane
      type after the Santos-Dumont or Bleriot models, the following details will
      be found useful.
Santos-Dumont—The latest production of this maker is called the "No.
      20 Baby." It is of 18 feet spread, and 20 feet over all in depth. It
      stands 4 feet 2 inches in height, not counting the propeller. When this
      latter is in a vertical position the extreme height of the machine is 7
      feet 5 inches. It is strictly a one-man apparatus. The total surface area
      is 115 square feet. The total weight of the monoplane with engine and
      propeller is 352 pounds. Santos-Dumont weighs 110 pounds, so the entire
      weight carried while in flight is 462 pounds, or about 3.6 pounds per
      square foot of surface.
Bamboo is used in the construction of the body frame, and also for the
      frame of the tail. The body frame consists of three bamboo poles about 2
      inches in diameter at the forward end and tapering to about 1 inch at the
      rear. These poles are jointed with brass sockets near the rear of the main
      plane so they may be taken apart easily for convenience in housing or
      transportation. The main plane is built upon four transverse spars of ash,
      set at a slight dihedral angle, two being placed on each side of the
      central bamboo. These spars are about 2 inches wide by 1 1/8-inch deep for
      a few feet each side of the center of the machine, and from there taper
      down to an inch in depth at the center bamboo, and at their outer ends,
      but the width remains the same throughout their entire length. The planes
      are double surfaced with silk and laced above and below the bamboo ribs
      which run fore and aft under the main spars and terminate in a forked clip
      through which a wire is strung for lacing on the silk. The tail consists
      of a horizontal and vertical surface placed on a universal joint about 10
      feet back of the rear edge of the main plane. Both of these surfaces are
      flat and consist of a silk covering stretched upon bamboo ribs. The
      horizontal surface is 6 feet 5 inches across, and 4 feet 9 inches from
      front to back. The vertical surface is of the same width (6 feet 5 inches)
      but is only 3 feet 7 inches from front to back. All the details of
      construction are shown in the accompanying illustration.
Power is furnished by a very light (110 pounds) Darracq motor, of the
      double-opposed-cylinder type. It has a bore of 4.118 inches, and stroke of
      4.724 inches, runs at 1,800 r. p. m., and with a 6 1/2-foot propeller
      develops a thrust of 242 1/2 pounds when the monoplane is held steady.
Bleriot—No. XI, the latest of the Bleriot productions, and the
      greatest record maker of the lot, is 28 feet in spread of main plane, and
      depth of 6 feet in largest part. This would give a main surface of 168
      square feet, but as the ends of the plane are sharply tapered from the
      rear, the actual surface is reduced to 150 square feet. Projecting from
      the main frame is an elongated tail (shown in the illustration) which
      carries the horizontal and vertical rudders. The former is made in three
      sections. The center piece is 6 feet 1 inch in spread, and 2 feet 10
      inches in depth, containing 17 square feet of surface. The end sections,
      which are made movable for warping purposes, are each 2 feet 10 inches
      square, the combined surface area in the entire horizontal rudder being 33
      square feet. The vertical rudder contains 4 1/2 square feet of surface,
      making the entire supporting area 187 1/2 square feet.
From the outer end of the propeller shaft in front to the extreme rear
      edge of the vertical rudder, the machine is 25 feet deep. Deducting the
      6-foot depth of the main plane leaves 19 feet as the length of the rudder
      beam and rudders. The motor equipment consists of a 3-cylinder, air-cooled
      engine of about 30 h. p. placed at the front end of the body frame, and
      carrying on its crankshaft a two-bladed propeller 6 feet 8 inches in
      diameter. The engine speed is about 1,250 r. p. m. at which the propeller
      develops a thrust of over 200 pounds.
The Bleriot XI complete weighs 484 pounds, and with operator and fuel
      supply ready for a 25- or 30-mile flight, 715 pounds. One peculiarity of
      the Bleriot construction is that, while the ribs of the main plane are
      curved, there is no preliminary bending of the pieces as in other forms of
      construction. Bleriot has his rib pieces cut a little longer than required
      and, by springing them into place, secures the necessary curvature. A good
      view of the Bleriot plane framework is given on page 63.
Combined Triplane and Biplane.
At Norwich, Conn., the Stebbins-Geynet Co., after several years of
      experiment, has begun the manufacture of a combination triplane and
      biplane machine. The center plane, which is located about midway between
      the upper and lower surfaces, is made removable. The change from triplane
      to biplane, or vice versa, may be readily made in a few minutes. The
      constructors claim for this type of air craft a large supporting surface
      area with the minimum of dimensions in planes. Although this machine has
      only 24-foot spread and is only 26 feet over all, its total amount of
      supporting area is 400 square feet; weight, 600 pounds in flying order,
      and lifting capacity approximately 700 pounds more.
The frame is made entirely of a selected grade of Oregon spruce, finished
      down to a smooth surface and varnished. All struts are fish-shaped and set
      in aluminum sockets, which are bolted to top and lower beams with special
      strong bolts of small diameter. The middle plane is set inside the six
      uprights and held in place by aluminum castings. A flexible twisted
      seven-strand wire cable and Stebbins-Geynet turnbuckles are used for
      trussing.
The top plane is in three sections, laced together. It has a 24-foot
      spread and is 7 feet in depth. The middle plane is in two sections each of
      7 1/2 feet spread and 6 feet in depth. The center ends of the middle plane
      sections do not come within 5 feet of joining, this open space being left
      for the engine. The bottom plane is of 16 feet spread and 5 feet in depth.
      It will thus be seen that the planes overhang one another in depth, the
      bottom one being the smallest in this respect. The planes are set at an
      angle of 9 degrees, and there is a clear space of 3 1/2 feet between each,
      making the total distance from the bottom to the top plane a trifle over 7
      feet. The total supporting surface in the main planes is 350 square feet.
      By arranging the three plane surfaces at an angle as described and varying
      their size, the greatest amount of lifting area is secured above the
      center of gravity, and the greatest weight carried below.
The ribs are made of laminated spruce, finished down to 1/2x3/4-inch cross
      section dimensions, with a curvature of about 1 in 20, and fastened to the
      beams with special aluminum castings. Number 2 Naiad aeroplane cloth is
      used in covering the planes, with pockets sewn in for the ribs.
Two combination elevating rudders are set up well in front, each having 18
      square feet of supporting area. These rudders are arranged to work in
      unison, independently, or in opposite directions. In the Model B machine,
      there are also two small rear elevating rudders, which work in unison with
      the front rudders. One vertical rudder of 10 square feet is suspended in
      the rear of a small stationary horizontal plane in Model A, while the
      vertical rudder on Model B is only 6 square feet in size. The elevating
      rudders are arranged so as to act as stabilizing planes when the machine
      is in flight. The wing tips are held in place with a special two-piece
      casting which forms a hinge, and makes a quick detachable joint. Wing tips
      are also used in balancing.
Model A is equipped with a Cameron 25-30 h. p., 4-cylinder, air-cooled
      motor. On Model B a Holmes rotary 7-cylinder motor of 4x4-inch bore and
      stroke is used.
Positive control is secured by use of the Stebbins-Geynet "auto-control"
      system. A pull or push movement operates the elevating rudders, while the
      balancing is done by means of side movements or slight turns. The rear
      vertical rudder is manipulated by means of a foot lever.
New Cody Biplane.
Among the comparatively new biplanes is one constructed by Willard F.
      Cody, of London, Eng., the principal distinctive feature of which is an
      automatic control which works independently of the hand levers. For the
      other control a long lever carrying a steering wheel furnishes all the
      necessary control movements, there being no footwork at all. The lever is
      universally jointed and when moved fore and aft operates the two ailerons
      as if they were one; when the shaft is rotated it moves the tail as a
      whole. The horizontal tail component is immovable. When the lever is moved
      from side to side it works not only the ailerons and the independent
      elevators, but also through a peculiar arrangement, the vertical rear
      rudder as well.
The spread of the planes is 46 feet 6 inches and the width 6 feet 6
      inches. The ailerons jut out 1 foot 6 inches on each side of the machine
      and are 13 feet 6 inches long. The cross-shaped tail is supported by an
      outrigger composed of two long bamboos and of this the vertical plane is 9
      feet by 4 feet, while the horizontal plane is 8 feet by 4 feet. The
      over-all length of the machine is 36 feet. The lifting surface is 857
      square feet. It will weigh, with a pilot, 1,450 pounds. The distance
      between the main planes is 8 feet 6 inches, which is a rather notable
      feature in this flyer.
The propeller has a diameter of 11 feet and 2 inches with a 13-foot 6-inch
      pitch; it is driven at 560 revolutions by a chain, and the gear reduction
      between the chain and propeller shaft is two to one.
The machine from elevator to tail plane bristles in original points. The
      hump in the ribs has been cut away entirely, so that although the plane is
      double surfaced, the surfaces are closest together at a point which
      approximates the center of pressure. The plane is practically of two
      stream-line forms, of which one is the continuation of the other. This
      construction, claims the inventor, will give increased lift, and decreased
      head resistance. The trials substantiate this, as the angle of incidence
      in flying is only about one in twenty-six.
The ribs in the main planes are made of strips of silver spruce one-half
      by one-half inch, while those in the ailerons are solid and one-fourth
      inch thick. In the main planes the fabric is held down with thin wooden
      fillets. Cody's planes are noted for their neatness, rigidity and
      smoothness. Pegamoid fabric is used throughout.
Pressey Automatic Control.
Another ingenious system of automatic control has been perfected by Dr. J.
      B. Pressey, of Newport News, Va. The aeroplane is equipped with a manually
      operated, vertical rudder, (3), at the stern, and a horizontal, manually
      operated, front control, (4), in front. At the ends of the main plane, and
      about midway between the upper and lower sections thereof, there are
      supplemental planes, (5).
In connection with these supplemental planes (5), there is employed a
      gravity influenced weight, the aviator in his seat, for holding them in a
      horizontal, or substantially horizontal, position when the main plane is
      traveling on an even keel; and for causing them to tip when the main plane
      dips laterally, to port or starboard, the planes (5) having a lifting
      effect upon the depressed end of the main plane, and a depressing effect
      upon the lifted end of the main plane, so as to correct such lateral dip
      of the main plane, and restore it to an even keel. To the forward, upper
      edge of planes (5) connection is made by means of rod (13) to one arm of a
      bellcrank lever, (14) the latter being pivotally mounted upon a fore and
      aft pin (15), supported from the main plane; and the other arms of the
      port and starboard bellcrank levers (16), are connected by rod (17), which
      has an eye (18), for receiving the segmental rod (19), secured to and
      projecting from cross bar on seat supporting yoke (7). When, therefore,
      the main plane tips downwardly on the starboard side, the rod (17) will be
      moved bodily to starboard, and the starboard balancing plane (5) will be
      inclined so as to raise its forward edge and depress its rear edge, while,
      at the same time, the port balancing plane (5), will be inclined so as to
      depress its forward edge, and raise its rear edge, thereby causing the
      starboard balancing plane to exert a lifting effect, and the port
      balancing plane to exert a depressing effect upon the main plane, with the
      result of restoring the main plane to an even keel, at which time the
      balancing planes (5), will have resumed their normal, horizontal position.
When the main plane dips downwardly on the port side, a reverse action
      takes place, with the like result of restoring the main plane to an even
      keel. In order to correct forward and aft dip of the main plane, fore and
      aft balancing planes (20) and (23) are provided. These planes are carried
      by transverse rock shafts, which may be pivotally mounted in any suitable
      way, upon structures carried by main plane. In the present instance, the
      forward balancing plane is pivotally mounted in extensions (21) of the
      frame (22) which carries the forward, manually operated, horizontal
      ascending and descending plane
It is absolutely necessary, in making a turn with an aeroplane, if that
      turn is to be made in safety, that the main plane shall be inclined, or
      "banked," to a degree proportional to the radius of the curve and to the
      speed of the aeroplane. Each different curve, at the same speed, demands a
      different inclination, as is also demanded by each variation in speed in
      rounding like curves. This invention gives the desired result with
      absolute certainty.
The Sellers' Multiplane.
Another innovation is a multiplane, or four-surfaced machine, built and
      operated by M. B. Sellers, formerly of Grahn, Ky., but now located at
      Norwood, Ga. Aside from the use of four sustaining surfaces, the novelty
      in the Sellers machine lies in the fact that it is operated successfully
      with an 8 h. p. motor, which is the smallest yet used in actual flight. In
      describing his work, Mr. Sellers says his purpose has been to develop the
      efficiency of the surfaces to a point where flight may be obtained with
      the minimum of power and, judging by the results accomplished, he has
      succeeded. In a letter written to the authors of this book, Mr. Sellers
      says:
"I dislike having my machine called a quadruplane, because the number of
      planes is immaterial; the distinctive feature being the arrangement of the
      planes in steps; a better name would be step aeroplane, or step plane.
"The machine as patented, comprises two or more planes arranged in step
      form, the highest being in front. The machine I am now using has four
      planes 3 ft. x 18 ft.; total about 200 square feet; camber (arch) 1 in 16.
"The vertical keel is for lateral stability; the rudder for direction.
      This is the first machine (so far as I know) to have a combination of
      wheels and runners or skids (Oct. 1908). The wheels rise up automatically
      when the machine leaves the ground, so that it may alight on the runners.
"A Duthirt & Chalmers 2-cylinder opposed, 3 1/8-inch engine was used
      first, and several hundred short flights were made. The engine gave four
      brake h. p., which was barely sufficient for continued flight. The
      aeroplane complete with this engine weighed 78 pounds. The engine now used
      is a Bates 3 5/8-inch, 2-cylinder opposed, showing 8 h. p., and apparently
      giving plenty of power. The weight of aeroplane with this engine is now
      110 pounds. Owing to poor grounds only short flights have been made, the
      longest to date (Dec. 31, 1910) being about 1,000 feet.
"In building the present machine, my object was to produce a safe, slow,
      light, and small h. p. aeroplane, a purpose which I have accomplished."

CHAPTER XIII. PECULIARITIES OF AIRSHIP POWER.
As a general proposition it takes much more power to propel an airship a
      given number of miles in a certain time than it does an automobile
      carrying a far heavier load. Automobiles with a gross load of 4,000
      pounds, and equipped with engines of 30 horsepower, have travelled
      considerable distances at the rate of 50 miles an hour. This is an
      equivalent of about 134 pounds per horsepower. For an average modern
      flying machine, with a total load, machine and passengers, of 1,200
      pounds, and equipped with a 50-horsepower engine, 50 miles an hour is the
      maximum. Here we have the equivalent of exactly 24 pounds per horsepower.
      Why this great difference?
No less an authority than Mr. Octave Chanute answers the question in a
      plain, easily understood manner. He says:
"In the case of an automobile the ground furnishes a stable support; in
      the case of a flying machine the engine must furnish the support and also
      velocity by which the apparatus is sustained in the air."
Pressure of the Wind.
Air pressure is a big factor in the matter of aeroplane horsepower.
      Allowing that a dead calm exists, a body moving in the atmosphere creates
      more or less resistance. The faster it moves, the greater is this
      resistance. Moving at the rate of 60 miles an hour the resistance, or wind
      pressure, is approximately 50 pounds to the square foot of surface
      presented. If the moving object is advancing at a right angle to the wind
      the following table will give the horsepower effect of the resistance per
      square foot of surface at various speeds.
Horse Power
          Miles per Hour    per sq. foot
          10             0.013
          15             0 044
          20             0.105
          25             0.205
          30             0.354
          40             0.84
          50             1.64
          60             2.83
          80             6.72
          100            13.12
While the pressure per square foot at 60 miles an hour, is only 1.64
      horsepower, at 100 miles, less than double the speed, it has increased to
      13.12 horsepower, or exactly eight times as much. In other words the
      pressure of the wind increases with the square of the velocity. Wind at 10
      miles an hour has four times more pressure than wind at 5 miles an hour.
How to Determine Upon Power.
This element of air resistance must be taken into consideration in
      determining the engine horsepower required. When the machine is under
      headway sufficient to raise it from the ground (about 20 miles an hour),
      each square foot of surface resistance, will require nearly nine-tenths of
      a horsepower to overcome the wind pressure, and propel the machine through
      the air. As shown in the table the ratio of power required increases
      rapidly as the speed increases until at 60 miles an hour approximately 3
      horsepower is needed.
In a machine like the Curtiss the area of wind-exposed surface is about 15
      square feet. On the basis of this resistance moving the machine at 40
      miles an hour would require 12 horsepower. This computation covers only
      the machine's power to overcome resistance. It does not cover the power
      exerted in propelling the machine forward after the air pressure is
      overcome. To meet this important requirement Mr. Curtiss finds it
      necessary to use a 50-horsepower engine. Of this power, as has been
      already stated, 12 horsepower is consumed in meeting the wind pressure,
      leaving 38 horsepower for the purpose of making progress.
The flying machine must move faster than the air to which it is opposed.
      Unless it does this there can be no direct progress. If the two forces are
      equal there is no straight-ahead advancement. Take, for sake of
      illustration, a case in which an aeroplane, which has developed a speed of
      30 miles an hour, meets a wind velocity of equal force moving in an
      opposite direction. What is the result? There can be no advance because it
      is a contest between two evenly matched forces. The aeroplane stands
      still. The only way to get out of the difficulty is for the operator to
      wait for more favorable conditions, or bring his machine to the ground in
      the usual manner by manipulation of the control system.
Take another case. An aeroplane, capable of making 50 miles an hour in a
      calm, is met by a head wind of 25 miles an hour. How much progress does
      the aeroplane make? Obviously it is 25 miles an hour over the ground.
Put the proposition in still another way. If the wind is blowing harder
      than it is possible for the engine power to overcome, the machine will be
      forced backward.
Wind Pressure a Necessity.
While all this is true, the fact remains that wind pressure, up to a
      certain stage, is an absolute necessity in aerial navigation. The
      atmosphere itself has very little real supporting power, especially if
      inactive. If a body heavier than air is to remain afloat it must move
      rapidly while in suspension.
One of the best illustrations of this is to be found in skating over thin
      ice. Every school boy knows that if he moves with speed he may skate or
      glide in safety across a thin sheet of ice that would not begin to bear
      his weight if he were standing still. Exactly the same proposition obtains
      in the case of the flying machine.
The non-technical reason why the support of the machine becomes easier as
      the speed increases is that the sustaining power of the atmosphere
      increases with the resistance, and the speed with which the object is
      moving increases this resistance. With a velocity of 12 miles an hour the
      weight of the machine is practically reduced by 230 pounds. Thus, if under
      a condition of absolute calm it were possible to sustain a weight of 770
      pounds, the same atmosphere would sustain a weight of 1,000 pounds moving
      at a speed of 12 miles an hour. This sustaining power increases rapidly as
      the speed increases. While at 12 miles the sustaining power is figured at
      230 pounds, at 24 miles it is four times as great, or 920 pounds.
Supporting Area of Birds.
One of the things which all producing aviators seek to copy is the motive
      power of birds, particularly in their relation to the area of support.
      Close investigation has established the fact that the larger the bird the
      less is the relative area of support required to secure a given result.
      This is shown in the following table:
Supporting
                  Weight       Surface       Horse      area
     Bird         in lbs.     in sq. feet   power     per lb.
     Pigeon         1.00      0.7           0.012     0.7
     Wild Goose     9.00      2.65          0.026     0.2833
     Buzzard        5.00      5.03          0.015     1.06
     Condor        17.00      9.85          0.043     0.57
So far as known the condor is the largest of modern birds. It has a wing
      stretch of 10 feet from tip to tip, a supporting area of about 10 square
      feet, and weighs 17 pounds. It. is capable of exerting perhaps 1-30
      horsepower. (These figures are, of course, approximate.) Comparing the
      condor with the buzzard with a wing stretch of 6 feet, supporting area of
      5 square feet, and a little over 1-100 horsepower, it may be seen that,
      broadly speaking, the larger the bird the less surface area (relatively)
      is needed for its support in the air.
Comparison With Aeroplanes.
If we compare the bird figures with those made possible by the development
      of the aeroplane it will be readily seen that man has made a wonderful
      advance in imitating the results produced by nature. Here are the figures:
Supporting
                     Weight      Surface       Horse      area

While the average supporting surface is in favor of the aeroplane, this is
      more than overbalanced by the greater amount of horsepower required for
      the weight lifted. The average supporting surface in birds is about
      three-quarters of a square foot per pound. In the average aeroplane it is
      about one-half square foot per pound. On the other hand the average
      aeroplane has a lifting capacity of 24 pounds per horsepower, while the
      buzzard, for instance, lifts 5 pounds with 15-100 of a horsepower. If the
      Wright machine—which has a lifting power of 50 pounds per horsepower—should
      be alone considered the showing would be much more favorable to the
      aeroplane, but it would not be a fair comparison.
More Surface, Less Power.
Broadly speaking, the larger the supporting area the less will be the
      power required. Wright, by the use of 538 square feet of supporting
      surface, gets along with an engine of 25 horsepower. Curtiss, who uses
      only 258 square feet of surface, finds an engine of 50 horsepower is
      needed. Other things, such as frame, etc., being equal, it stands to
      reason that a reduction in the area of supporting surface will
      correspondingly reduce the weight of the machine. Thus we have the Curtiss
      machine with its 258 square feet of surface, weighing only 600 pounds
      (without operator), but requiring double the horsepower of the Wright
      machine with 538 square feet of surface and weighing 1,100 pounds. This
      demonstrates in a forceful way the proposition that the larger the surface
      the less power will be needed.
But there is a limit, on account of its bulk and awkwardness in handling,
      beyond which the surface area cannot be enlarged. Otherwise it might be
      possible to equip and operate aeroplanes satisfactorily with engines of 15
      horsepower, or even less.
The Fuel Consumption Problem.
Fuel consumption is a prime factor in the production of engine power. The
      veriest mechanical tyro knows in a general way that the more power is
      secured the more fuel must be consumed, allowing that there is no
      difference in the power-producing qualities of the material used. But few
      of us understand just what the ratio of increase is, or how it is caused.
      This proposition is one of keen interest in connection with aviation.
Let us cite a problem which will illustrate the point quoted: Allowing
      that it takes a given amount of gasolene to propel a flying machine a
      given distance, half the way with the wind, and half against it, the wind
      blowing at one-half the speed of the machine, what will be the increase in
      fuel consumption?
Increase of Thirty Per Cent.
On the face of it there would seem to be no call for an increase as the
      resistance met when going against the wind is apparently offset by the
      propulsive force of the wind when the machine is travelling with it. This,
      however, is called faulty reasoning. The increase in fuel consumption, as
      figured by Mr. F. W. Lanchester, of the Royal Society of Arts, will be
      fully 30 per cent over the amount required for a similar operation of the
      machine in still air. If the journey should be made at right angles to the
      wind under the same conditions the increase would be 15 per cent.
In other words Mr. Lanchester maintains that the work done by the motor in
      making headway against the wind for a certain distance calls for more
      engine energy, and consequently more fuel by 30 per cent, than is saved by
      the helping force of the wind on the return journey.

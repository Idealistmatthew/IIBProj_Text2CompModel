AVIATION DEVELOPMENT.
The wonderful progress made in the science of aviation during the year
      1911 far surpasses any twelve months' advancement recorded. The
      advancement has not been confined to any country or continent, since every
      part of the world is taking its part in aviation history making.
The rapidly increasing interest in aviation has brought forth schools for
      the instruction of flying in both the old and new world, and licensed air
      pilots before they receive their sanctions from the governing aero clubs
      of their country are required to pass an extremely trying examination in
      actual flights. Exhibition flights and races were common in all parts of
      the world during 1911, and touring aviators visited India, China, Japan,
      South Africa, Australia and South America, giving exhibitions and
      instruction.
Europe was the scene of a number of cross-country races in which entries
      ranging from ten to twenty aviators flew from city to city around a given
      circuit, which in some instances exceeded 1,000 miles in distance.
      Cross-country flights with and without passengers became so common that
      those of less than two hours' duration attracted little attention. There
      were fewer attempts at high altitude soaring, although the world's record
      in this department of aviation was bettered several times. In place of
      these high flights, the aviators devoted more attention to speed, duration
      and spectacular manoeuvres, which appeared to satisfy the spectators. The
      prize money won during 1911 exceeded $1,000,000, but owing to the
      increased number of aviators the individual winnings were not as large as
      in 1910.
It is estimated that within the past twelve months more than 300,000 miles
      have been covered in aeroplane flights and more than seven thousand
      persons, classed either as aviators or passengers, taken up into the air.
      The aeroplane of today ranges through monoplane, biplane, triplane and
      even quadraplane, and more than two hundred types of these machines are in
      use.
Aeroplanes are becoming a factor of international commerce. The records of
      the Bureau of Statistics show that more than $50,000 worth of aeroplanes
      were imported into, and exported from, the United States in the months of
      July, August and September, 1911. The Bureau of Statistics only began the
      maintenance of a separate record of this comparatively new article of
      commerce with the opening of the fiscal year 1911-12.
Two of the prominent developments of 1911 were the introduction of the
      hydro-aeroplane and the motorless glider experiments of the Wright
      brothers at Killdevil Hills, N. C., where during the two weeks'
      experiments numerous flights with and against the wind were made,
      culminating in the establishing of a record by Orville Wright on October
      25, 1911, when in a 52-mile per hour blow he reached an elevation of 225
      feet and remained in the air 10 minutes and 34 seconds. The search for the
      secret of automatic stability still continues, and though some remarkable
      progress has been made the solution has not yet been reached.
